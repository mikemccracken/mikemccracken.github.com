Since my new blogging setup doesn't automatically pull pinboard links
into summary posts like before, I'm going to run through my bookmarks
manually. Sound like fun? Let's go:

* [Our approach to replication in computational science](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/apr-12/replication-i) - "bioinformatician makes code and all analyses available. very admirable, and yet a little worrying that this is so rare. It is also rare in computer science, where it is arguably easier to share."
* [ModSquadHockey Forums](http://www.modsquadhockey.com/forums/) - good reviews of equipment with painful forum UI. BTW, yes, a Bauer Concept II full shield will definitely fit a Stealth S19 (2010 model) helmet. You're welcome.
* [Hockey Helmet Cage/Visor Compatibility Charts](http://www.hockeymonkey.com/helmet-compatibility-charts.html) - really useful, but sadly not fully complete. An impossible task.
* [Opengazer: open source gaze tracker for ordinary webcams](http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/opengazer/) - Presented without comment. Have you used this?
* [Storm Python ORM](https://storm.canonical.com/) - Python ORM from Canonical, used in launchpad.
* [What it takes to build great machine learning products](http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/04/great-machine-learning-products.html) - I think the answer was careful definition of the problem domain?
* [A calculator that only shows the answer after you give a suitable estimate](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3851691) - Really cool idea. The magic is in how to adjust the tolerance so it seems fair. Linked to the HN post because the comments are so polarized - it's interesting to swatch people violently miss the point.
* [GNU Parallel](http://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/) - Well if you don't know, now you know: "GNU parallel is a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel using one or more computers." Super useful. You don't have to use GNU parallel if you like something else that's similar, but you should probably know at least one tool for this stuff.
* [GNOME + Do](http://do.cooperteam.net/) - quicksilver for gnome. I left out the part in the page title that says "Crazy Delicious" because come on, people. These are computers.
* [Field visualization software](http://openendedgroup.com/field/) - "An environment for writing code to rapidly and experimentally assemble and explore algorithmic systems" - A really fascinating project. It looks like big ball of squeak, python, and processing that Bret Victor rolled up. I wanted to try it out in April but haven't had a chance.
* [circa](http://circa-lang.org/about/introduction.html) - A programming language that lets you manipulate the AST and do round trips. I forget what I meant by that exactly. I also wrote that 'state is first class'. You'd better go look at the page if that sounds interesting. Don't ask me!


That's it for April. Look for May's bookmarks sometime in 2014.
