<p>I haven&#8217;t used MobileMe mail for several years, mostly because the couple hundred dollars I spent on .Mac without ever really getting much use out of it, before finally canceling it far too late, still kind of stings.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How well does GMail let me create filters to handle heavy traffic lists?</p>

<p>GMail is not perfect, but it&#8217;s got the workflow down right.
When I want to add a filter, I am probably looking at a message that I want the filter to match. So GMail&#8217;s &#8220;Filter messages like this&#8221; command is a great match. They also know about lists, and they auto-populate the search command for the filter with the &#8220;list:list@foo.com&#8221; style search. This works out pretty great, and I&#8217;ve been using GMail for lists for years.</p>

<p>It works to divert the flood out of my inbox, but it can also mean that for lists that aren&#8217;t related to my job, I have basically unsubscribed to the list - out of sight, out of mind.
I sometimes add filters to automatically &#8220;star&#8221; conversations I&#8217;m likely to want to look at, but that&#8217;s not the best choice - it overloads the meaning of the star, and I&#8217;d rather see either tags that aren&#8217;t full labels (and don&#8217;t clutter up my label list) or a some other flag-like bit that is only set by filters to say when something might be interesting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How well does Thunderbird 3 let me create filters to handle heavy traffic lists?</p>

<p>There&#8217;s not much support for using a message to build a filter from, which I think is the most natural workflow. The menu item &#8220;Tools > Message Filters…&#8221; opens a dialog box that could use some simplification. For example, the buttons to move filters up and down in order are unnecessary - you should be able to just drag the filters around in the table. There are plenty of other non-mac-like UI elements here. Another example of overcomplicated UI is the &#8220;Filter Log&#8221; button. At best this is an &#8220;advanced&#8221; preference, but it&#8217;s a big button at the top - and it&#8217;s misnamed. It opens a sheet to let you turn the logging on, but who knows how you actually view the logging?</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l33l1uJlv51qz505e.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are some other UI problems when trying to add the filter - I didn&#8217;t think ahead of time that I&#8217;d need to create the folder to send the filtered messages to. The Message Filters dialog seems modal, because the menubar goes away when it&#8217;s in focus, but it&#8217;s not really - so I just created the new folder back on the main window while the new-filter sheet was still open. A little strange, but it worked.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also lacking a way to do a dry-run of the filter- to test which messages will match, before just letting it loose on your mailbox. This is a really important feature, especially when filters can do destructive or un-recoverable things like running a script (not in Thunderbird, but present in other mailers) or send a response.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One thing that can make a big difference in a client is how well it helps you cope with heavy-traffic lists. Sometimes we need to stay on top of a firehose, and a client that helps filter out the noise and lets you keep track of what&#8217;s going on in sometimes very long threads is an invaluable tool.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll find plenty of opinions about how to do this, but I think it&#8217;s well established that daily digests are not a great way to deal with traffic. It&#8217;s great to only check things occasionally, but most list software doesn&#8217;t let you say when it&#8217;ll dump the huge pile into your inbox, and most mail software doesn&#8217;t handle the multipart/digest format very well - usually it just gets combined into one big message.</p>

<p>I think the best way is first to filter the list messages out of the inbox, and only check in on it every so often (more often if it&#8217;s an important list for your job). You want to be able to quickly skim what&#8217;s new since you last checked in - new threads, what changed in threads you&#8217;ve looked at already, etc. One way to do this is to have another filter to flag messages that are &#8220;interesting&#8221; in some way - either to me or mentioning me or my topics of interest, or from interesting people.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to spread out comments on each client into a few posts over the next few days.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had an idea the other day that I shared on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote><p>@mikemccracken: It would be cool if there was a way for well-used &amp; loved GUI software to gracefully show its age, like a good leather wallet…</p></blockquote>

<p>I still like this idea, and I loved the example that <a href="https://twitter.com/skabaru">Bryan Knight</a> replied with - the OS 8 Color Picker crayons, seen in the third &#8220;Colour Selector&#8221; image on the <a href="http://guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/macos80">OS 8 GUIdebook page</a>.</p>

<p>However, it just occurred to me that it&#8217;d be hard to design a UI that shows its age or use gracefully without looking &#8220;dirty&#8221; and triggering the kind of OCD that makes some of us empty the trash just because the icon looks full. I can think of a few other things that do that to me:</p>

<ul>
<li>Of course, the full trash can</li>
<li>Unread counts of all kinds</li>
<li>MS Word 08 showing &#8220;[Compatibility Mode]&#8221; in the window title for files that aren&#8217;t .docx format</li>
<li>Badges on files in the finder that show source control status - I tried this once and it drove me crazy</li>
</ul>


<p>There are probably more. Share yours in the comments if you like. I&#8217;d also be really interested in other examples besides the crayons where UI changes gracefully as you use the software more…</p>

<p>Apple&#8217;s Mobile Me mail - a webmail that always struck me as trying too hard to be like a desktop mail client - has been re-designed, and it added two features that I completely agree with in a mail client - widescreen view (a message should be the entire height of a window) and a one-click archive button, to help achieve <a href="http://inboxzero.com">Inbox Zero</a> as fast as possible.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I ran across this video in my bookmarks - this looks like the result of Yahoo acquiring <a href="http://xoopit.com/">Xoopit</a>. It looks like they&#8217;ve got a platform for building &#8220;applications&#8221; that users can add into their webmail client. (Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/mailapplications/">developer info</a> )</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a little like Facebook&#8217;s games and other apps, and I&#8217;d be surprised if that&#8217;s not what they&#8217;re competing with. However, it&#8217;s another good idea from web apps that would work in desktop apps too - why not allow other applications to easily see and work with the data you&#8217;ve got in mail? This kind of app could either be a plug-in add-on to the mail client or a separate app that just accesses the mail data directly. Supporting both would be great.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m writing a presentation with <a href="http://bitbucket.org/rivanvx/beamer/wiki/Home">Beamer</a>, a LaTeX class for making PDF slides.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a built-in way to generate &#8220;notes&#8221;, which was geared towards Acrobat Reader - it basically makes a double-wide PDF page and Reader will show the &#8216;notes&#8217; page on the second screen. (I&#8217;m guessing it assumes your laptop screen is arranged on the right of your presentation screen, it&#8217;s the same size or bigger, etc&#8230;)</p>

<p>This doesn&#8217;t work for my personal favorite PDF reader, <a href="http://skim-app.sf.net">Skim</a> - but luckily there is a full explanation of how to make it work on the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/skim-app/index.php?title=Tips_and_Tricks#Interaction_with_LaTeX_Beamer">Skim Wiki: Tips and Tricks page</a>. The short of it is you create three tex files - one with all the content and two wrappers that generate two versions of the same presentation. One version has slides and the other has notes. Then you can set up Skim to auto-scroll the notes PDF as you move through the slides PDF in presentation mode.</p>

<p>Big thanks to whoever wrote that tip - and to Christiaan for making such a great app.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Occasionally, I&#8217;m going to take a break from nit-picking existing mail clients to point to some interesting new ideas for email. It&#8217;ll be focused on ideas you can use soon, that work with existing email standards - I&#8217;m going to hold off on talking about Google Wave until I understand what it&#8217;s really for.</p>

<p>Today, there&#8217;s <a href="http://kwaga.com/">Kwaga</a> - they have a desktop app that shows you what&#8217;s important in your inboxes. I haven&#8217;t tried it, but from the website I can tell that they have a lot of good ideas about what might make an email important, and they&#8217;re willing to spend some CPU cycles to figure it out.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s basically a service that reads your mail, does some processing, and tells you if there&#8217;s something you need to see - either it&#8217;s important or it&#8217;s a request of some kind, etc. The desktop app then links you back to the web client you use for mail, either GMail or Yahoo.</p>

<p>I love the idea of automated importance filtering - but I haven&#8217;t tried it, because I <em>dont</em> like the fact that their server reads my email to do the filtering. If they have a desktop app, why not do that processing on the desktop? To be fair, they do say that the servers do not store the emails, and they&#8217;re moving to OAuth for GMail, so they won&#8217;t even store your passwords. But it still doesn&#8217;t sit well, and promises like that won&#8217;t fly at work.</p>

<p>Anyway, it looks like this kind of thing might be the closest most of us will get to having a personal assistant - so it&#8217;s worth taking a look at. If anyone reading tries it, please let us know in the comments what you think.</p>

<p>This might be going down a rathole here, but I think I&#8217;d like <em>read</em> to mean that I&#8217;ve had the chance to see it…</p>

<p>I think the important thing here is separating &#8220;I&#8217;m done with this&#8221; from &#8220;Read&#8221; - which is not the way clients are written these days. Read should just be metadata. It&#8217;s OK to archive things I haven&#8217;t read.</p>
