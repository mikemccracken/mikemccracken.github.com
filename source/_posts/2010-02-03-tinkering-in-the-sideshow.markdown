Last week, [Alex Payne][al3x] and [Mark Pilgrim][mark] both made some heartfelt arguments explaining why they think the fact that Apple's vision of the computing future as a relatively closed appliance is depressing. I agree, and I want to explain exactly why, now that I think I've figured it out.

Each post got plenty of responses. Dissenters have a wide variety of reasons for why it's no big deal, ranging from "tomorrows tinkerers will just play with different technology, like [bio-mecha](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2010/01/29/tinkerers-sunset#comment-13600)" (fascinating!), to a lot of people saying, essentially, "Just don't buy the appliance if you want a computer" (obvious!). 

Others have made a solid point that the iPad is the next big computing paradigm. Steven Frank calls it a ["New World"][stevenf] device. I can't help but agree, and of course powerful devices that empower instead of confuse the user are a good thing. Replacing most of the world's overcomplicated, fussy laptops with focused and reliable devices is a good thing. 

Of course, general purpose, hackable computers are not really going away, not soon. Even if everyone uses an iPad for personal stuff and a Chrome OS netbook to access private cloud services for business work, there will still be a need for workstations, and I hope the people building complete personal systems out of Free Software don't give up.

However, in a response to comments on his post, [Mark Pilgrim made a gloomy prediction][markpred]: "People havenâ€™t figured it out yet, but Mac OS X is on its last legs. By 2015, Apple will make appliances and developer add-ons. Not general purpose computing devices." 

If you ask me, this is the real problem.

The problem is that hackable computers *that I want to use* could very well be fading out. Maybe Mark's overstating things, but I would not be surprised to see the Mac, and OS X, as a relatively low priority for Apple in the near future. Design and development effort and creativity will naturally go increasingly toward the more profitable platform - the one making computing finally pleasant for the normal person.

I'm worried that this will happen for third-party developers too. [I'm not the only one.][vs] Back in 2002, Brent Simmons described developing user code for the Mac as ["the show"][show]. Is there any doubt that Apple's mobile OS is "the show" now? 

Where does that leave the rest of us who still have to or want to use a more powerful platform?
