Now that I don't have regular access to cable TV, the sensation I felt when I noticed the [announcement of NHL playoff video available on iTunes](http://www.nhl.com/news/2006/05/273278.html) was that of Steve Jobs signing my name on a check for ten dollars and winking.

Each video is ~20 minutes of highlights, and the video quality, while suffering from the same problems I noticed [previously][scrubspost], is pretty good.

Check out the previews here: [Eastern Conference Finals](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewTVSeason?id=154789015&s;=143441) and [Western Conference Finals](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewTVSeason?id=154789015&s;=143441).
