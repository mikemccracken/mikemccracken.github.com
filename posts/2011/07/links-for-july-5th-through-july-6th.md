My shared links for July 5th through July 6th:






  * [Overlay Scrollbars - Update Â« Canonical Design](http://design.canonical.com/2011/07/overlay-scrollbars-update/) - They have a video of the new scrollbar design for Ubuntu. 
I'm not sure I like it but it's hard to say without using it first.

One nit - I don't think it's obvious what happens to the red position bar (what to call that?) when you just press the arrows on the thumb instead of moving it around.


  * [pulp-or - puLP: An LP modeler in Python - Google Project Hosting](http://code.google.com/p/pulp-or/) Linear Programming solvers!


  * [CouchDB: The Definitive Guide](http://guide.couchdb.org/index.html) - The couchdb oreilly book. (free full text and drafts)
