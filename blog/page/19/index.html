  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last spring, when I <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/wp/?p=48">wrote</a> about highlights from the NHL Playoffs being available on the iTunes store, I said:</p>

<blockquote><p>the sensation I felt when I noticed the announcement of NHL playoff video available on iTunes was that of Steve Jobs signing my name on a check for ten dollars and winking.</p></blockquote>

<p>This weekend, when I saw this: <a href="http://video.google.com/nhl.html">video.google.com/nhl.html</a> - free videos of every NHL game, including historic games, I went plain nuts. Go check it out, even if you don&#8217;t know you like hockey yet. If you don&#8217;t have a team, may I suggest the <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=owner%3Anhl+penguins&amp;hl=en&amp;page=1&amp;so=1">Pittsburgh Penguins</a>? There&#8217;s probably still time to become a Penguins fan without being a bandwagon fan, but it&#8217;s running out&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been mentioned before, for example <a href="http://digg.com/apple/New_iTunes_7_SKIP_COUNT_feature">on Digg</a>, but iTunes 7 has a new feature that counts the number of times you&#8217;ve <em>skipped</em> a track, which is defined as playing the song for at least two seconds but no longer than twenty (after which it is counted as played fully).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m curious how they chose twenty seconds as the cutoff - when I was working on an (unreleased and unfinished) project for generating smart shuffles, I defined skips as not listening past the first fifteen seconds, but didn&#8217;t count a full play until the song ended.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s an interesting feature, and it&#8217;s apparently kept up to date by some iPods, so I can see it helping me keep bad songs off my small iPod by using it in a smart playlist rule. However, often I find myself skipping songs I really like because I&#8217;m just not feeling them at the moment. So - how about the option of a smart playlist rule that lets me define a skip percentage? If I skip a song far more often than I play it, then it&#8217;s a pretty good bet I don&#8217;t need it on my iPod.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For those few readers who are interested in High Performance Computing and might be going to this year&#8217;s <a href="http://sc06.supercomputing.org/">Supercomputing</a> conference in Tampa, my advisor Allan Snavely and Jeremy Kepner from Lincoln Labs are putting on a BOF with an intriguing subject: <a href="http://sc06.supercomputing.org/schedule/event_detail.php?evid=5193">&#8220;Is 99% Utilization of a Supercomputer a Good Thing?&#8221;</a></p>

<p>It&#8217;ll be on Thursday Nov. 16th at 12:15PM.</p>

<p>As with all really interesting questions, this has a quick, easy answer that reveals your point of view. My immediate answer is &#8220;No&#8221;, because of the productivity problems the focus on high utilization causes for many HPC users, mainly through the use of a batch queue. However, when considering the interests of everyone involved (including the people who have to evaluate how money is spent on these systems), the only responsible way to answer is &#8220;it depends&#8221;.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s an interesting topic that never fails to generate some controversy, and from what I can tell we&#8217;ll have some diverse speakers at the BOF (including myself, discussing user surveys we&#8217;ve conducted as part of DARPA HPCS). It should be enlightening.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My Powerbook&#8217;s been back for a couple of weeks now, and I had a good overall experience dealing with <a href="http://ocdatarecovery.com/">OC Data Recovery</a> to get my data off the drive. Their San Diego Location is in Sorrento Valley. I didn&#8217;t test their speed, since my main concern was cost, but they managed to get about 98% of my files back by their estimate, and my most important files are fine: my VoodooPad notes, my preferences, and my iTunes purchased music. Everything else is duplicated elsewhere - all my projects and research files, for instance - but some things change often enough that even weekly backups aren&#8217;t often enough, like my notes in VoodooPad.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s a relief, but the $2,200 cost should be a warning to anyone who hasn&#8217;t taken the time to start a comprehensive backup strategy - if the idea of spending a few hundred bucks on backup media is stopping you, consider that a likely alternative is to wait and spend much, much more to get <em>almost</em> back to square one, without any way of knowing for sure which files are OK or even present until you need them later. That&#8217;s not a good scene.</p>

<p>So <em>back it up</em>.</p>

<p>Finally, despite <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/blog/blosxom.pl/2005/10/28#dontRestoreWithBackup3">earlier reservations</a>, my current backup scheme does use Apple&#8217;s Backup 3 - I&#8217;ve tested it a few times recently and I&#8217;m comfortable with its restoring, and it&#8217;s just simpler to use than Retrospect for some things like very frequent backups to .mac and backing up to multiple DVDs. Those programs are the only ones I own, so I can&#8217;t say anything useful about alternatives. I&#8217;ve heard good things about other programs, and the cardinal rule is to use whatever makes it easiest for you to back up often, starting <em>now</em>, and don&#8217;t worry about finding the perfect solution first.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Andy Ihnatko paints <a href="http://www.macuser.com/ihnatko/ihnatko_harsh_words_for_window.php">a colorful picture of Windows use</a>. He describes Windows as first the boorish, greasy haired acquaintance on a long road-trip, then later as disposable underpants. I can&#8217;t resist anthropomorphizations and descriptions of software as other daily objects.</p>

<p>I wasn&#8217;t going to post that article, but just now I was keeping notes in Notepad and wanted to write something unrelated down quickly, so I press control-N. You know, &#8220;New&#8221;. A dialog box pops up, and before I realize it, I&#8217;ve lost the notes I was keeping, because I accidentally hit &#8220;No&#8221; in response to &#8220;Do you want to save the changes?&#8221;. OK, my mistake, but in my defense, I wasn&#8217;t expecting that decision and didn&#8217;t really read the dialog box, surely the twentieth dialog I&#8217;ve seen in two hours.</p>

<p>Also, why am I closing one file to open a new one? In Firefox, if I press control-N, I get a new window and my old one is still there. What&#8217;s the deal, Notepad? Do most real Windows users just never use you?</p>

<p>I miss VoodooPad.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thanks to <a href="http://gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2006/09/my_dream_app_voting.html">Gus</a>,
I took a quick tour through the <a href="http://mydreamapp.com">MyDreamApp</a> finalists today, and voted for two of them, Portal and Blossom. Portal is a long shot - it&#8217;s basically proposing to solve multi-computer file syncing seamlessly, but it would be great if done right. See Wil Shipley&#8217;s comments for why it&#8217;s hard. Merging is not easy.</p>

<p>Blossom is a great idea to link productivity nannying with emotional appeal - work hard and your desktop plant grows! It needs a new name, but with the right design and art, I think it&#8217;d be a hit. If they took a cue from the Nike+iPod <a href="http://www.cabel.name/2006/08/multiplayer-game-of-year.html">multiplayer game</a>, we could compete on productivity - make work a game and compete to see who can build the biggest, healthiest desktop plant. Brilliant!</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s <em>Windows User Fun Fact:</em> I had to use Internet Explorer to see the entries on the MyDreamApp page - Firefox didn&#8217;t show the entry details when I clicked on the pictures.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been a Windows User for two weeks now. Since <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/wp/?p=64">my powerbook disk died</a>, I&#8217;ve been working on a loaner Dell Lattitude with XP.</p>

<p>I get by. It&#8217;s not as hard as I would have guessed. Most of my work these days just needs a decent terminal, and SSH from ssh.com (who knew there was a commercial SSH?) works OK. I don&#8217;t understand why it doesn&#8217;t save my keyboard preferences, but I muddle through.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m using <a href="http://www.washington.edu/pine/">pine</a> for email, and the lack of <a href="http://c-command.com/spamsieve">SpamSieve</a> is shockingly obvious. Sometimes control characters in spam emails garble the screen so badly that I can&#8217;t tell what I&#8217;m deleting.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I use Firefox, and Google calendar keeps my schedule. So far, I haven&#8217;t missed my iCal integration applescripts (<a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/blog/blosxom.pl/computers/mac/todoQuickSilver.html">new-todo-in-quicksilver</a>,
<a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/blog/blosxom.pl/computers/mac/programming/ASiCal.html">new-event-from-email</a>, and <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/wp/?p=30">new-todo-from-email</a>), but I&#8217;m sure I will if this goes on longer.</p>

<p>I miss the years of notes I had inVoodooPad. In its place, I&#8217;ve been using emacs org-mode in a terminal. I like the outlining and todo/agenda gathering it can do, and wouldn&#8217;t be opposed to similar features in VoodooPad. I&#8217;d actually been using it in the weeks before my forced <em>switch</em>, but just for the todos.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve accidentally tried to print about a hundred times when editing text, expecting the old emacs shortcuts to be there. This is OK, though, because I can&#8217;t configure printers.</p>

<p>There is a similar story for almost every key shortcut I want to use - I have no idea how to switch between tabs in Firefox, and when I did find out how to minimize windows from the keyboard (Alt-space, &#8216;n&#8217;), I wished I hadn&#8217;t, because it only works in half of the programs I use.</p>

<p>One thing Windows does is make me want to give up earlier. I actually just don&#8217;t care if I can&#8217;t figure out a good way to do something. This is an exciting new feeling - I just give up and get back to work, and each time, I feel a little more like a real grownup. You know, how you feel after all your youthful dreams have died.</p>

<p>I get more done at work with Windows. I no longer install programs just to try them out (scary!), or hack on minor projects (no friendly tools built-in). Even just surfing around is just not as tempting, and I do less of it, both at work and at home. In moments of weakness, I have considered swapping my PowerBook for three pound Windows laptop, just so I can finish sooner and with better posture. I know I could never do it, but the thought lingers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been thinking of how I&#8217;d work if I didn&#8217;t have a laptop. One thing&#8217;s for sure: I wouldn&#8217;t spend as much time rubbing my neck while waiting for builds, for a couple of reasons.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m beginning to wonder if a laptop is really any good at all, let alone necessary. Wouldn&#8217;t I rather not carry that thing around all the time? Should my hands really sweat when my <em>computer</em> is working hard? Doesn&#8217;t having a laptop just give me an excuse to pretend I&#8217;ll be able keep working &#8220;later&#8221;, even though that never really works? Does anyone really gain more <em>productivity</em> from working at a coffee shop than they would using a fast desktop computer?</p>

<p>I think the one thing my laptop is best at is blurring the line between <em>fun</em> and <em>work</em>, and not in a good way for either.</p>

<p>With the heat, weight, relatively poor performance, and especially the paranoia from carrying such an expensive thing around, I&#8217;ve grown to seriously resent my Powerbook, despite being at quite a loss without it.</p>

<p>Has anyone found a good way around the extreme dependence on heavy, fragile, hot-plate laptops, and still been able to get things done in more than one place? Anyone carrying Mac minis around between monitors? Carrying a disk between minis? Strict work/home division? What&#8217;s your scheme?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My Powerbook&#8217;s disk died yesterday around 1pm. Since then I&#8217;ve been thinking about how to get by without it.
After taking far too long to realize it was beyond my troubleshooting ability, I took it to the UTC Apple store at 5 or so, and got an appointment for 7:45, then went for a drink. When I came back, the Apple store guy referred me to drivesavers - I&#8217;ll have to see what their estimate is when they call me back. For now, I assume I&#8217;ll have to pay whatever they ask - I was careful about backing up notes and papers to my iDisk and keeping important work files in repositories on other machines, but there is still a lot of stuff on that machine that I can&#8217;t replace, and my full-backup scheme was just inconvenient enough (and my target disk just small enough) that my full backup is pretty stale.</p>

<p>I can keep working for now on lab computers and my old home Mac - I&#8217;m pretty impressed with how much I can just transfer over to another mac and keep running - I can check all my mail (IMAP or GMail), read my NetNewsWire subscriptions (Newsgator Online), go through my bookmarks (iSync &amp; .mac). Pretty impressive, even without any effort to stay flexible.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s hoping I can be back on track soon - for now I&#8217;m only a Mac user at nights, and I&#8217;m going to miss a few things during the days, to be sure.</p>
