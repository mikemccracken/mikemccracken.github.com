My shared links for June 30th to July 1st:






  * [WordPress for iOS](http://ios.wordpress.org/) - I didn't know this existed. Looks pretty nice.


  * [@hotdogsladies on the email charter idea](http://twitter.com/#!/hotdogsladies/status/86535776535449601) - 


  * [Circles: Facebook's reality failure is Google+'s opportunity](http://www.wordyard.com/2011/06/30/circles-facebooks-reality-failure-is-googles-opportunity/) - He likes the ability to group people differently, something Facebook sort of has, but never made easy. I like the idea too, but I think they could go further - sometimes you might want the type of relationship you have to be public. I'm not on G+, so I don't know if that's possible. Can you make circle names public sometimes?


  * [We Have to Fix E-Mail - NYTimes.com](http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/30/we-have-to-fix-e-mail/) - Pogue likes the email charter. He adds a few good ideas that seem like common sense to me. Like Chuq said, isn't this just netiquette?


  * [American McCarver](http://americanmccarver.com/tagged/hockey/rss) - Hockey-only RSS feed for the new sports weblog:  (sorry, @gruber)
