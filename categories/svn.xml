&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt;: It looks like this customization only exists in Emacs 23.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is that vc-mode uses a standard function, &lt;code&gt;pop-to-buffer&lt;/code&gt;, to create the new window for vc-diff and vc-log. This is the function that keeps creating horizontal splits that make no sense on my widescreen display. However, it ends up calling a function called &lt;code&gt;split-window-sensibly&lt;/code&gt;, which can be customized (of course!). So, if I set the "Split Height Threshold" to nil, &lt;code&gt;split-window-sensibly&lt;/code&gt; will never split horizontally, and then the default behavior just magically does what I want. If I start with just a single vc-dir window and invoke vc-diff and vc-log, I get my three columns!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get to the right customization screen, just do &lt;code&gt;M-x customize-apropos &amp;lt;ret&amp;gt; ^Split.*Threshold&lt;/code&gt;. That'll get you the two relevant customization items. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>emacs</category><category>svn</category><category>vc</category><category>workflow</category><guid>http://michael-mccracken.net/2009/09/better-svn-workflow-in-emacs/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 18 Sep 2009 19:36:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Subversion Client Issues</title><link>http://michael-mccracken.net/2009/07/subversion-clients/</link><dc:creator>Michael McCracken</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I use subversion, and won't switch to something newer for a while, so it's worth looking at how to polish that old hammer. I'm used to using the command line svn, or emacs. But recently I decided to try out a few of the nice GUI clients that are around, including &lt;a href="http://versionsapp.com/"&gt;Versions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://zigzig.com/"&gt;ZigVersion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.zennaware.com/cornerstone/"&gt;Cornerstone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these, the only one that's polished enough to lure me away from emacs and seems to support my favorite mode of working is Cornerstone, and it still gets it a little wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to write log comments while looking at (and scrolling through) the diffs for the files I'm committing. This means I want a text field for writing log comments on the same screen as the diffs, that isn't modal, and doesn't stop me from moving around between multiple diffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I could tell, I couldn't get the comment field and the diff display shown together in Versions, and while I could in ZigVersion, that app had a subpar diff display and lacked polish overall, missing key shortcuts where I'd expect them, for instance. Cornerstone almost lets me do what I want, but it displays the comment field in a modal sheet, so I have to cancel to change which diff I'm looking at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is easy in emacs, but I like a nicer diff GUI. Am I just missing something? This feels like a natural workflow, so it seems strange that no clients support it well.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>gui</category><category>mac</category><category>programming</category><category>svn</category><guid>http://michael-mccracken.net/2009/07/subversion-clients/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jul 2009 14:17:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
