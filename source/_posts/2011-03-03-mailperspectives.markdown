[MailPerspectives](http://www.indev.ca/MailPerspectives.html) is a new plugin from indev software for Apple Mail. It adds new window styles that are more compact than the standard Mail window, with improved keyboard navigation to process your messages more quickly.

Take a look at the interactive HTML virtual tour - probably the best app-marketing scheme I've seen, because it's more informative than a screenshot but less intrusive than a screencastâ€¦

It's beginning to feel like a golden age for mac email clients.
