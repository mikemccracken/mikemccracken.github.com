Just something I noticed in Postbox just now - when I select a thread, it marks every message as read whether or not it was actually displayed.

This might be going down a rathole here, but I think I'd like *read* to mean that I've had the chance to see itâ€¦

I think the important thing here is separating "I'm done with this" from "Read" - which is not the way clients are written these days. Read should just be metadata. It's OK to archive things I haven't read.
