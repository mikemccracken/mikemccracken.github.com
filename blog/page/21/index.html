  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I took my camera with me on a late-night food run. On the way back, I stopped at the end of Felspar street and took some shots of the beach scene. My favorite two are already up at Flickr, but I thought I&#8217;d expand on them a bit here.</p>

<p>This is the end of Crystal Pier, which houses a hotel (you can see the last of the cabins on the left). I took a bunch of these shots, playing with the sensitivity and exposure. This was the longest - at ISO 200 and f/4.0, exposed for about 10 seconds.</p>

<p>Even with an f/1.4 lens, it was super dark and I had to focus manually. I set the camera on a post and used a 2-second delayed shutter to keep it still and out of my shaky hands.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelmccracken/186275976/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/65/186275976_91ad85b289.jpg" alt="Crystal Pier" /></a></p>

<p>For comparison, here&#8217;s a version taken at ISO 1600 :</p>

<p><img src="http://michael-mccracken.net/img/IMGP0243.jpg" alt="Crystal Pier at ISO 1600" /></p>

<p>Even reduced in size, you can really notice the noise.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a shot of a cleaning lady working at JRDN, the swank bar in the new Tower 23 hotel. Tower 23 doesn&#8217;t really fit in in PB - it&#8217;s way too self-conscious and preening of a place to feel natural in such a laid-back, seedy beach neighborhood. It seemed appropriate that on a Sunday night when the more relaxed established places like the PB Bar &amp; Grill and Longboards were really hopping, JRDN was closed - looking its ghostly best.</p>

<p>I should have remembered that I&#8217;d set the 2-second delay before I took this shot - I had the woman framed well, hit the shutter and wondered what was going on. Luckily, she stayed in the door frame, but I could swear it was a better shot just two seconds before.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelmccracken/186275981/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/17/186275981_97a6aa094c.jpg" alt="Bar cleanup" /></a></p>

<p>Here&#8217;s another missed shot opportunity, as she ducks behind the bar just as I find the right exposure and focus. I think the color in the other one makes it better, but the angle of the bar on this one has some promise. Shot through a couple of layers of glass, and manual focus - I&#8217;m sure it could be sharper if I&#8217;d kept trying.</p>

<p><a href="http://weblog.scifihifi.com/">Buzz Andersen</a> was in town for the 4th of July, and we both took a few photos, up on Flickr: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/ldandersen/tags/sandiego/">Buzz&#8217;s San Diego Photos</a>, and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/michaelmccracken/tags/buzz/">my photos of Buzz</a>.</p>

<p>When I get the film back from the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/michaelmccracken/tags/yashica/">Yashica</a>, I&#8217;ll scan some more photos in.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I&#8217;ve been getting more into photography, so if you want the full MMC web experience, you could subscribe to a <a href="http://flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?id=51035756035@N01&amp;format;=rss_200">feed of my photos</a>, which should already be part of my <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Michael-mccrackennet">feedburner feed</a>. And if you&#8217;re a fellow Flickr photo nut, feel free to add me as a contact and tell me when I reach  photo genius.</p>

<p>PS, I&#8217;ve been working with the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/lightroom/">Adobe Lightroom beta</a> to process my pictures lately. I really like the focus on workflow, and the UI is very responsive on my old PowerBook G4. It does get a little slower when dealing with 6MP RAW photos, but almost never beachballs. Furthermore, single key shortcuts are priceless for a program aimed at serious users.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over at <a href="http://macresearch.org/">macresearch.org</a>, they&#8217;ve posted a nice <a href="http://www.macresearch.org/bibdesk_a_free_bibliography_management_application">review of BibDesk</a>. One quote: &#8220;If you use Latex search no more, this is a killer app.&#8221; Kudos to Adam and Christiaan.</p>

<p>I see an increasing number of Macs at research meetings I go to, and I usually can&#8217;t help but peek on their dock to look for that yellow folder. I usually don&#8217;t ask people if they&#8217;ve heard of it, but I have thought of putting a big sticker with the BibDesk icon on my PowerBook, just to see if anyone recognizes it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Even after <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/wp/?p=44">moving web-based mail to a separate app</a>, I still usually have at least two browsers open at all times - Camino when something doesn&#8217;t load in Safari, Firefox for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2240/">tails</a> (a <a href="http://microformats.org">microformats</a> helper), and Safari, which I&#8217;m used to, has my bookmarks, and auto-fills forms.</p>

<p>Safari freezes and crashes pretty often for me, but I can&#8217;t easily switch away from it because it has my history, both in actual saved history and collections of bookmarks which always seem to get dumped into an &#8216;Import&#8217; folder when you move between browsers.</p>

<p>Browser history doesn&#8217;t seem like a lot of data. It seems like a natural choice to keep in a central place, just like the OS X Address Book. However, I don&#8217;t know of any effort that takes the user&#8217;s point of view and lets us keep a separate history list, so we don&#8217;t have to lose data every time we want to try out a new browser.</p>

<p>So - anyone want to step to the plate? Hopefully all it would take is a good API and one browser that works with it - if one WebKit-based browser (OmniWeb) and one Gecko-based browser (Camino) adopted this, it would take something big to make me use Safari again. If a browser imported other browsers&#8217; history <em>and</em> made it easy to save &amp; search that history separately, I couldn&#8217;t think of a reason not to try it out, and see what other features I might like.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>From <a href="http://bldgblog.blogspot.com">BLDGBLOG</a>, some <a href="http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2006/05/rooms-of-algebraic-theology.html">pictures and romantic musings</a> about everyone&#8217;s favorite kind of computer - big, expensive, finicky and shared: the Supercomputer.</p>

<p>Be sure to click through to see the picture of the <a href="http://www.bsc.es/resources/marenostrum,en.htm">MareNostrum</a> system filling a glass box in a chapel in Barcelona. There are more great photos on photographer <a href="http://www.simonnorfolk.com/">Simon Norfolk&#8217;s site</a>.</p>

<p>I wish there was more well-done photography of these systems - not all are nearly as photogenic overall as MareNostrum, but there are plenty of great details, and so many are already lost to history. My vote for favorite detail is the Cray 2 coolant waterfall:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.spikynorman.dsl.pipex.com/CrayWWWStuff/Criscan/Cray2cascade.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>(It&#8217;s the blue glowing thing in the top center - from <a href="http://www.spikynorman.dsl.pipex.com/CrayWWWStuff/Cfaqp2.html">SpikyNorman.net</a>)</p>

<p>Here are some interesting quotes from the BLDGBLOG post:</p>

<blockquote><p>These computers, Norfolk continues, &#8216;are omniscient and omnipresent and these are not qualities in which we find a simulacrum of ourselves - these are qualities that describe the Divine. The problem is not that these computers might one day resemble humans; it is that they already resemble gods.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>I would say <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem">Golem</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>So if I were forced to take issue with the existence of these machines, it would not be because of their use in modeling new nuclear warheads - as Norfolk makes clear they do - but in something far more secondary, even faintly absurd: what I&#8217;d call the lack of a <em>supercomputer poetics</em>, or a more imaginative role for these machines to play in our literary and even religious lives. Oracular, Delphic, radically non-secular: they are either all or none of the above.</p></blockquote>

<p>If we&#8217;d all agree to think clearly about climate science, there&#8217;s quite a bit of Oracular prediction using supercomputers going on there. I&#8217;d love to see high-performance computing become more a part of the culture, as computer security undoubtedly has. I think such stories are unlikely to be told visually, though - it&#8217;s hard to imagine how it&#8217;d be done without being either overdramatized and silly or dreadfully boring. After all, how do you make a movie out of editing text and waiting?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now that I don&#8217;t have regular access to cable TV, the sensation I felt when I noticed the <a href="http://www.nhl.com/news/2006/05/273278.html">announcement of NHL playoff video available on iTunes</a> was that of Steve Jobs signing my name on a check for ten dollars and winking.</p>

<p>Each video is ~20 minutes of highlights, and the video quality, while suffering from the same problems I noticed <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/wp/?p=40">previously</a>, is pretty good.</p>

<p>Check out the previews here: <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewTVSeason?id=154789015&amp;s;=143441">Eastern Conference Finals</a> and <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewTVSeason?id=154789015&amp;s;=143441">Western Conference Finals</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The old debate over donation-ware and pricing has popped up again, in response to <a href="http://www.petermaurer.de/">Peter Maurer</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://www.petermaurer.de/nasi.php?section=textpander&amp;layout;=default">Textpander</a>, since expanded into <a href="http://www.smileonmymac.com/textexpander/">TextExpander</a>. The debate rages in comments on <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2006/05/23/smileonmymac-releases-textexpander-1-3-the-customizable-typing/">TUAW</a> and a bit more on <a href="http://hawkwings.net/2006/05/25/developers-let-them-eat-cake/">HawkWings</a>. Both TUAW and the <a href="http://www.macuser.com/software/textexpander_13_released.php">MacUser</a> blog choose to call it &#8220;freeware&#8221;, which is technically true, but blurs the lines in an important way.</p>

<p>Peter&#8217;s stuff is released with no price, just a polite suggestion over on the side: &#8220;If you decide to use Witch regularly, please do consider making a donation.&#8221; He doesn&#8217;t say how much. In my experience, even getting a $5 donation from a happy user is really a boost. Free coffee in the morning is awfully nice - add in a comment saying what you like about my app, and it makes me want to impress you with something new.</p>

<p>Writing software, even small apps, is not easy. A nice polished donationware app with all the trimmings represents a serious investment of time. When I was working on <a href="http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/">BibDesk</a>, I would hack on it for 4-5 hours at a time every couple of days. As I&#8217;ve discovered over the past year or so, it&#8217;s not something you can really do intermittently.</p>

<p>I bet that many of Peter&#8217;s Textpander users have real jobs. We grad students call you &#8220;real people.&#8221; If a real person goes for one week at grande instead of venti, or ate ramen for a night instead of going to Outback, the change is more than enough to make the Mac software world a better place.</p>

<p>Why? Just think of all the bad apps you have to pay for from big companies who don&#8217;t really get it, and then think whether a few bucks is worth it to support software that actually works the way you like. Your dollar might be the one that seals the decision for the next <a href="http://flyingmeat.com">Gus Mueller</a>, <a href="http://connectedflow.com">Fraser Speirs</a>, <a href="http://www.gauchosoft.com/">Mike Piatek-Jimenez</a>, <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/">Daniel Jalkut</a> or <a href="http://www.cocoatech.com">Steve Gehrman</a> to start developing full-time.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m glad to hear that Peter made some money. You might think that $30 is too much for TextExpander, but don&#8217;t fault him for selling his app - he doesn&#8217;t owe us anything, not after the huge gift of his free time and talent he already donated to us.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>XCode 2.3 is out, so why not spend a nice May evening reading some <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/update.html">Dev Tools release notes</a>?</p>

<p>There are some excited posts about Dedicated Network Builds from <a href="http://chanson.livejournal.com/145343.html">people who work at Apple</a>, but not having a cluster of build machines myself, I&#8217;m not so worked up. (Unless sourceforge gets on that for their build farm.)</p>

<p>Then I saw this one line buried a little past halfway through:</p>

<ul>
<li>Nibtool</li>
<li>Added functionality for exporting and importing properties as a plist
Nibtool can extract properties into a plist format that can be edited and then reimported into the nib using the new &#8211;export (-e) and &#8211;import (-i) flags.</li>
</ul>


<p>If I read this right, it means the door is open for easy automated access to bindings and maybe a way to make editing bindings easier. I know visual programming has its benefits, but bindings are just so <em>opaque</em> - you see one object&#8217;s binding at a time, and making mass changes to bindings is just impossible - <em>until now, I hope</em>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m downloading it now.</p>

<p>Some people got what I was trying to do with it, and some didn&#8217;t. The idea got passed around a bit, so a few commenters probably didn&#8217;t read my original post. That&#8217;s not a big deal, but I did want to clear up a few points that weren&#8217;t obvious from what I did write.</p>

<h4>I don&#8217;t hate Apple Mail.</h4>

<p>I didn&#8217;t say anything about disliking or replacing Apple Mail. Mail is my <em>primary</em> mail client, and there&#8217;s plenty about it that I like. I just use both, since I like GMail better for viewing mailing lists.</p>

<h4>WebMail.app was not a mission statement for the web.</h4>

<p>I like rich local clients. I don&#8217;t think that apps like WebMail are the future of desktop apps.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think that cloning WebMail.app for any given website/web app will necessarily be a good idea. Sometimes it will, but if you could benefit from system-specific GUI features or services like Spotlight, CoreImage, AddressBook integration, control over data backup, etc, then just another browser window won&#8217;t help you. For instance - I can&#8217;t think of any reason to move flickr browsing to a mini-browser like WebMail. I don&#8217;t need to avoid distraction when I&#8217;m using flickr - I&#8217;m <em>already</em> distracted.</p>

<p>Also, I&#8217;m not qualified to expound on the future of the web, so let&#8217;s not get ahead of ourselves there.</p>

<h4>I wanted it to be a bad browser.</h4>

<p>This was the part that got people who didn&#8217;t read what I wrote in the original post about distraction. Yes, you could get almost the same effect by using real browsers with their toolbars off, but the whole point was to make it hard to distract yourself on the web.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a fine line where if you add any more features, you&#8217;re re-implementing a real browser, and that&#8217;s counterproductive. We can disagree on the position of that line, but I feel I hit it pretty close. For instance, if you want tabs, I think you should probably just use a real browser. And for my purposes, <em>not</em> being able to open links in other browsers is an important feature.</p>

<h4>It wasn&#8217;t a product announcement.</h4>

<p>I wrote it to avoid distraction - I&#8217;m not going to be supporting it, adding features, nor will I even work very hard to get an icon. I suggest using the icon mentioned in the <a href="http://www.hawkwings.net/2006/05/13/a-dedicated-distraction-free-browser-for-gmail/">Hawk Wings</a> post about it. That&#8217;s probably what I&#8217;ll do if I ever get around to it.</p>

<p>Some people suggested features that wouldn&#8217;t make it more distracting, including handling other web mail sites, doing the right thing with uploads for attachments, importing contacts, a better login interface (actually, I don&#8217;t get why you&#8217;d care about that), and using newer WebKit builds for better compatibility. I don&#8217;t plan to do any of these, but you&#8217;re welcome to. If anyone wants to use the name and take it in that direction, I&#8217;m OK with that - let me know.</p>

<p>I do use it, though, so if it ever breaks on a new system and there&#8217;s no good replacement, I&#8217;ll get it working again.</p>

<p>I have heard from at least one person who&#8217;s building a similar app and has done some more interesting things with it, so when I find out more about that, I&#8217;ll pass along a link. (But I&#8217;m not sure if it will be free or open source.)</p>

<h4>It was super easy.</h4>

<p>Now that I&#8217;ve addressed most of the criticisms that I wanted to, I want to ask that if you like this app, please reserve your praise for the Web Kit team at Apple - it took me months to realize that I wanted this app, but only minutes to build it because of all their hard work. It really was basically the demo app, and not even the one at the end of the talk. Thanks!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Webmail is really a separate application. When I&#8217;m visiting GMail, I&#8217;m <em>checking mail</em>, not browsing the web. So what&#8217;s so bad about using a browser for this?</p>

<h3>Minor Gripes</h3>

<p>If I keep a browser window running with GMail, now clicking on the Safari dock icon just brings that sucker up instead of creating a new empty window.</p>

<p>I love the GMail key shortcuts and Safari has an annoying tendency to get the key focus wrong so I have to click in the window somewhere after moving up out of a thread to get my shortcuts back.</p>

<p>Safari crashes, I forget to reload GMail, I miss important messages.</p>

<p>Even all that isn&#8217;t so bad. For a while I ran Firefox with only GMail open. I could get a GMail notifier so I won&#8217;t miss messages&#8230; but:</p>

<h3>The <em>Real</em> Problem</h3>

<p>The final straw is this: Every time I check mail, I&#8217;m diving right into the world&#8217;s biggest time-sink. My email isn&#8217;t usually a waste of my time, but all the windows I&#8217;ve left floating around, my bookmarks bar, or a quick Google search are. These are the things that eat up afternoons, and webmail is a gateway to that distraction.</p>

<p>Browsers have lots of features that I don&#8217;t need to use GMail: bookmarks, back &amp; forward buttons, a search field, page history, a location bar, and on and on.</p>

<h3>My Easy Way Out - the Minimalist Specialized Browser</h3>

<p>A while back, I wrote a separate web browser just for GMail.</p>

<p>All it does is load GMail in a nice big window and duck out of your way. <em>No location bar</em>. And <em>no bookmarks</em>.</p>

<p>It says: Go ahead and follow that link your friend (or bug tracker) sent you, but to check BoingBoing, you&#8217;re going to have to go over to Safari. Maybe you&#8217;ll decide to go back to work instead.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s basically the WebKit demo, except that I tried to improve the key shortcut situation a bit, and it has a progress indicator.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using it for a while now, and the only features of real browsers that I miss are pretty simple to add - text find, a refresh command. I just haven&#8217;t needed them that much. <del>Sadly, one feature I&#8217;d love to add to GMail, a key shortcut to &#8220;go to inbox&#8221;, eludes me, since their Javascript is pretty obfuscated.</del> Update - &#8220;go to inbox&#8221; already exists as the sequence &#8220;gi&#8221;.</p>

<h3>Meet WebMail.app</h3>

<p>If you want to try out this  idea without the hassle of writing those ten lines yourself, get a tarball here: <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/webmail-1.0.tgz">Webmail-1.0.tgz</a> and let me know what you think.</p>

<p>The source is in there, it&#8217;s BSD licensed, and I&#8217;ll happily accept patches that make it more useful for email, but remember that making it more useful for general browsing is kind of not the point.</p>

<p>Oh, and it lacks a real icon. Sorry.</p>

<p><em>Update</em> much later: a new version that supports printing and attaching files is available here: <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/2007/WebMail+printing+attaching.zip">Webmail+printing+attaching.zip</a></p>
