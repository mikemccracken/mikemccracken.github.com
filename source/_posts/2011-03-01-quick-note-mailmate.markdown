Link: [Quick note: MailMate](http://freron.com/)

Missed this until Michael Tsai mentioned it in the latest [Release Notes for SpamSieve](http://c-command.com/blog/2011/03/01/spamsieve-2-8-5/) - if MailMate works for me on 10.5, I'll give a review here.

Apparently, it's been in beta for over a year. Not sure how I missed it.
