The [Tomorrow's Professor Mailing List](http://ctl.stanford.edu/Tomprof/index.shtml), a great resource for tips and info about what professors actually do (as opposed to what you learn in grad school), is now out in a weblog form, in case you'd rather read in an aggregator than a mail client: [Tomorrow's Professor Blog](http://amps-tools.mit.edu/tomprofblog/)

I'd recommend poking through the back issues - there's a lot of wisdom in there.
