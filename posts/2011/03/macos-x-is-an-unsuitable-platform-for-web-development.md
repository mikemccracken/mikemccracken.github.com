Ted's probably the funniest person blogging about tech that I'm aware of.




Take note of the filename of the image he used for this post…



He just seems angry toward the end, but I'd say his technical points are awfully valid.

On the other hand, nothing's stopping anyone from using a Mac *and* developing on Linux - just use emacs over X11, and keep your great Mac apps for mail, chat, web browsing, etc… Honestly I never understood the need to have things work on your laptop if you're actually going to run it on some other server. Isn't that what networks are for?
