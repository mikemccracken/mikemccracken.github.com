  <div class="entry-content"><p>From <a href="http://twitter.com/spamsieve">@spamsieve</a>, I heard that BareBones&#8217; Mailsmith has a new home:  <a href="http://www.mailsmith.org">mailsmith.org</a>. It&#8217;s freeware and will be under development.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s great to see new life for one of the few alternative desktop mail clients for OS X, and while there&#8217;s no info on their plans for it yet, there&#8217;s some great discussion of possible features on the google group <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mailsmith-talk">mailsmith-talk</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be curious to see if any of the design choices will be changing - for example, no IMAP support and no inline HTML display&#8230; I have to use IMAP, and despite common abuse, I do think HTML email is useful.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong>: Looks like no Mailsmith IMAP: &#8220;Not any time soon…&#8221; – <a href="http://twitter.com/siegel/status/3386768085">@siegel on twitter</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Found via Hacker News:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.abi.sh/2009/silent-diving-seagulls/">abi | blog  » Introducing Silent Diving Seagulls: An XMPP Interface for Desktop Notifications</a></p>

<p>The idea here is that you can use XMPP to let web apps pop up Growl (or libnotify or Snarl, etc) notifications on your desktop. This is a pretty cool hack, and it seems like the right solution to getting notifications from the cloud onto your desktop - as Abi mentions in the post, you don&#8217;t want direct connections to Growl and you also don&#8217;t want every site writing its own notify app. It&#8217;s also another step in blurring the lines between web apps and desktop apps.</p>

<p>However, I think the majority of uses for this kind of notification are distracting and unproductive. The example Abi uses is getting updates from friendfeed - you&#8217;d get a notification every time one of your friends does anything on friendfeed. If you think hearing a beep every time you get new mail is distracting, just wait.</p>

<p>About the only use I&#8217;ve found for notifications is to let you know you can get back to work when something long you&#8217;ve been waiting for finishes. I wrote more about this in <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/wp/2008/08/28/go-juggle-an-attention-callback/">&#8216;go juggle&#8217;: an attention callback</a>.</p>

<p>So notification technology is useful, and it&#8217;s cool to see web apps getting into it, but please, web or desktop – ship with notifications off. Let&#8217;s not have the default behavior of your app be distraction.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong>: In the <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=755507">HN thread on Silent Diving Seagulls</a>, abi notes that he&#8217;s sensitive to the distraction this can cause, and makes some good points about why it&#8217;s still a good idea. The best point - if everyone adopts something like this, email goes back to being email and not an overloaded notification scheme.</p>

<p>This shows an example of an app built on top of google wave that has nothing to do with email and is really impressive and useful.</p>

<p>If I had to guess, wave will be a successful platform for lots of applications that don&#8217;t look much like email at all. And we&#8217;ll still have email as it exists today.</p>

<blockquote><p>Teams at apple are TINY. Mail is like 3 guys. …</p></blockquote>

<p>Two things: The thread was about how high quality software is easier without politics you get in large teams, which I agree with, and I bet that a lot of the software we love was made by smaller teams than you&#8217;d think.</p>

<p>And, just 3 engineers on Mail explains a lot.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just noticed this: <a href="http://www.artima.com/articles/two_way_binding.html">Two-Way Data Binding in Flex 4</a>.</p>

<p>Flex is an SDK for building Flash apps that I know nothing about, but this article presents what looks like a rough equivalent of Cocoa Bindings, and it has one really nice property that Cocoa has always been missing - say what you want about specifying a UI with XML, but the Flex XML looked like it&#8217;d be relatively easy to scan, search and diff. I&#8217;ve always thought that a human-readable text format for Cocoa NIBs would be a big improvement.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With all the news about web fonts lately, I&#8217;ve been thinking about typography as a difference between web apps and desktop apps. No one expects web apps to conform to any standard UI, so designers can experiment and give us distinctive interfaces, using different fonts and color schemes.</p>

<p>It seems like there&#8217;s less room to play in desktop apps - you&#8217;ll see unique interfaces with new button styles, new controls, different color schemes, but as far as I can tell, not much variation in typography.</p>

<p>The only example off the top of my head is Panic Sans, used in Coda.</p>

<p>Why so little variation?</p>

<p>Is it the presence of a standard system font, UI guidelines, or just habit?</p>

<p>Is there a licensing issue for redistributing fonts with software? I tried to look for licensing terms, but this doesn&#8217;t seem to be a common question.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#8217;t mind some more tasteful variation in my desktop apps - I think the best web apps have shown us that different isn&#8217;t always bad.</p>

<time datetime="2009-07-15T00:17:35-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jul 15<span>th</span>, 2009</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some responses I got to my post about SVN workflow pointed out TextMate&#8217;s SVN integration. It looks like I could do what I want in TextMate, but it didn&#8217;t look as smooth as the dedicated clients, and I might be wrong but it gave the impression that I couldn&#8217;t set it all up without a lot of mousing around. Since I&#8217;m an emacs addict, I&#8217;m probably not going to give TextMate a real try, but in this case I think there&#8217;d be no reason to. I&#8217;ll explain why.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not hard to get the layout I want in emacs with VC-mode. I put a screenshot below. On the left is a window (the whole OS window is an emacs &#8220;frame&#8221;) with dired under VC - the directory edit mode showing what&#8217;s modified. I&#8217;ve marked two of them so I can commit them together. In the middle I&#8217;m viewing the diff for one of the files, and on the right I&#8217;m editing the log entry for the entire commit. I can change things around without losing my log message - view other diffs, make edits, etc.</p>

<p><a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/wp2/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/emacs-snap.png"><img src="http://michael-mccracken.net/wp2/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/emacs-snap-1024x511.png" alt="SVN in Emacs: Dired under VC / VC-Diff / Log-Edit" /></a></p>

<p>The only real problem I have with this is that it takes a bit of manual window setup every time to get to this arrangement and clean up the diff buffers, and that the display could be nicer. Cornerstone fixes the display issue, and if it (or another SVN client) got the workflow right, it&#8217;d fix the first.</p>

<p>I wrote an emacs function once to do that setup automatically. I called it vc-checkin-mike, and it got about 80% of the way there. Enough to feel like I&#8217;d spent too much time on it, but not enough that I wanted to use it.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell from screenshots, TextMate is roughly in the same spot as emacs - I can do what I want but it takes a bit of manual setup, and it&#8217;s not as pretty as the dedicated clients like Cornerstone.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was listening to the <a href="http://www.coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a> podcast on dog walks for a while, and I sent in a question they covered in <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2009/05/episode-17-why-should-i-buy-this/">Episode 17</a> (hi guys - better late than never).</p>

<p>Since I&#8217;m in research, I think about future trends and what things are going to be like 5, or 10 years out. It&#8217;s fun, but it made me wonder when I listen to these indie dev guys - do they have a plan? What if web apps and Chrome OS take over everything (they won&#8217;t) or everything has to be seamlessly synced with some &#8220;cloud&#8221; (it will)? How will their apps and businesses react?</p>

<p>In answering, Daniel and Manton made a great point that&#8217;s a real positive for small, low-investment indie development - if the ground moves, they can pretty easily just stop what they&#8217;re doing and retool. Changing feature plans is fast, starting a new app project is fast. Projects can be dropped without laying off a bunch of people.</p>

<p>It was a real lesson in the agility of indie development. Now if only they&#8217;d post another podcast, and Austin would cool off enough for me to walk the dog for longer than a few minutes…</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wouldn&#8217;t normally post something about my weblog software, but I was apparently stumbling along with a really old wordpress that didn&#8217;t accept new comments anymore, so I&#8217;ve upgraded.</p>

<p>As a result my custom theme bit it, and I am fresh out of PHP edits. So I&#8217;m trying this twitter-inspired thing out, the new &#8220;P2&#8221; theme for wordpress. It might make a good place for things that won&#8217;t fit in twitter.</p>

<p>So say hi, leave a comment and let&#8217;s do this thing.</p>
