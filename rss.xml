Ubuntu Saucy as a guest on my Mac, and while it does work to connect
to the device once it's installed, the process of reflashing is
difficult. The manual steps on the Ubuntu Wiki
&lt;a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Install"&gt;Touch/Install&lt;/a&gt; page work for
the old way, via &lt;code&gt;phablet-flash cdimage-touch&lt;/code&gt;, with the caveat that
you may have to manually reboot the device and/or re-connect the USB
in between steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as of &lt;a href="https://lists.launchpad.net/ubuntu-phone/msg04004.html"&gt;this email last week&lt;/a&gt;, the official way
to flash phones is using the system images via &lt;code&gt;phablet-flash
ubuntu-system&lt;/code&gt;, which has a different set of files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of just muddling through and updating the manual instructions,
I decided to see if phablet-flash would run natively on the Mac. After
a bit of python dependency resolution, it does. Here's what I did:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the &lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html"&gt;Android SDK tools&lt;/a&gt;. You only really need the "SDK Tools", not the whole ADT Bundle, so I clicked on "Use an existing IDE" at the bottom of that page, to get the smaller installer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unpack the archive and run ./android. Install the platform-tools (and nothing else).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the platform-tools/ directory to your $PATH for convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Optional) create a virtualenv for the python dependencies, and activate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install&lt;/code&gt; each of &lt;code&gt;configobj&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;pyxdg&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;pyliblzma&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get &lt;a href="http://bazaar.canonical.com/"&gt;bazaar&lt;/a&gt; if you don't already have it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;branch phablet-tools: &lt;code&gt;bzr branch lp:phablet-tools&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd phablet-tools &amp;amp;&amp;amp; python setup.py build&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At this point, &lt;code&gt;phablet-flash ubuntu-system&lt;/code&gt; should work smoothly, with all transfers and reboots and timeouts going as expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only minor hiccup is that it apparently doesn't get ~/Downloads/
from pyxdg, but it just means that you'll get the images saved to
~/phablet-flash instead of ~/Downloads/phablet-flash. No big deal.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>nexus</category><category>ubuntu</category><category>ubuntutouch</category><guid>http://michael-mccracken.net/posts/2013/09/flashing-ubuntu-touch-from-osx.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2013 17:40:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Links: Simulation, Programming, Crab Cakes and Hockey Player Usage Charts</title><link>http://michael-mccracken.net/posts/2013/04/links.html</link><dc:creator>Michael McCracken</dc:creator><description>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/4710"&gt;DYNAMO&lt;/a&gt;

    Something to look out for -- a Python ggplot that works with HTML5 is a great idea. "Bokeh (pronounced boh-Kay) is an implementation of Grammar of Graphics for Python, that also supports the customized rendering flexibility of Protovis and d3. Although it is a Python library, its primary output backend is HTML5 Canvas.  There are many excellent plotting packages for Python, but they generally do not optimize for the particular needs of statistical plotting (easy faceting, bulk application of aesthetic and visual parameters across categorical variables, pleasing default color palettes for categorical data, etc.). The goal of Bokeh is to provide a compelling Python equivalent of ggplot in R."&lt;/li&gt;

    Player Usage Charts are fascinating, but I can never figure out why people always change the axes so that the dots fill the space. It makes it impossible to compare two charts, and it's not obvious, so you end up comparing charts without realizing that it's meaningless.&lt;/li&gt;

Its documentation is very good, and rewards multiple reads - but I found one thing that wasn't totally clear, even after looking through a few times.
I wanted to use PropertyMock to mock nested Properties. Specifically, I had patched the python Gnome-introspection wrapper for libsoup at the top level &lt;code&gt;Soup&lt;/code&gt; objcet, and I also wanted to replace one of its nested constant properties, Soup.MemoryUse.COPY with a sentinel that I controlled, for later comparison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idiom for PropertyMock is to assign a PropertyMock to the type object of the Mock object whose property you want control of.
What I found is that because Mocks auto-create properties, it's possible to do nested mocking in one line, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PropertyMock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sentinel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;my_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sentinel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;my_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So my soup example looks roughly like this (mixing testing and tested code, and repeating literals for brevity):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;json_body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"{}"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Soup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_soup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;gi.repository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Soup&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_soup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MemoryUse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;COPY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PropertyMock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sentinel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;COPY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c"&gt;# tested code:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Soup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"POST"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"http://fake.com/api"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;set_request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'application/json'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Soup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MemoryUse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;COPY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;json_body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;json_body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c"&gt;# checking:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_soup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mock_calls&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"POST"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"http://fake.com/api"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; 
                                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;set_request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'application/json'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
                                                                        &lt;span class="n"&gt;sentinel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;COPY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;# &amp;lt;--- this was the point&lt;/span&gt;
                                                                        &lt;span class="s"&gt;"{}"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's often possible to think of a shorter, clearer use of the mock library after revisiting a problem, but so far this still seems good. Let me know in the comments if you have a suggestion for improvements.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>http://michael-mccracken.net/posts/2013/02/mock-nested-properties-with-python-mock.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 21 Feb 2013 23:05:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Don't Snooze</title><link>http://michael-mccracken.net/posts/2013/02/dont-snooze.html</link><dc:creator>Michael McCracken</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Mailbox is a new iPhone email app that grabbed a lot of attention recently, partly because of their waiting list for using it.
It's a gmail-only system that stores copies of your email on Mailbox's servers, so they can do new features beyond the standard mail client.
Even though I got through the waiting list a week ago, I haven't tried it myself, because I wasn't &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a few religious beliefs about email.
One is that processing incoming email is different from &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that you should only process a message once - when you first see it, you should decide what to do next with it, even if that's "read it again later", &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call it a religion because I believe it, but I don't always practice
it. I have an inbox full of things I've looked at once and am
procrastinating on, partly because it's hard to move things to the
todo list that I use from Gmail. It annoys me every time I look at my
email, and I've forgotten important things that I left sitting
there. This is exactly why I think it's important that our tools
encourage good habits, instead of encoding bad ones.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>http://michael-mccracken.net/posts/2013/02/dont-snooze.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 08 Feb 2013 16:18:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Mac IRC clients</title><link>http://michael-mccracken.net/posts/2012/12/mac-irc-clients.html</link><dc:creator>Michael McCracken</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;At Canonical, we are spread all over and keep in touch via IRC. I've
tried out a bunch of IRC clients, but nothing is quite right. I'll
explain. Here's a list of some things I want from a client - it's
probably not complete, but it'll do for now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't crash. A bouncer makes crashes recoverable, but I shouldn't
 have to use one just to keep the backlog around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to search the backlog. Incremental search is best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show multiple channels at once, in one window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlight mentions of my nick so I can glance at a window and see if anyone's asking me something. Use Growl or notification center, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make it obvious when I've disconnected, and reconnect robustly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me hide/fade out join/leave notifications and other admin messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep my place so I know what messages are new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make it obvious which channel I'm looking at, and even more
 obvious which channel I'm about to type in. (Nothing is great at this)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spell-check is nice, but autocorrect is awful for IRC and
 technical discussions. Needs a global switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't show unread counts. Some channels are chatty and I'm just in them listening for my name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the clients I've tried and why they aren't quite perfect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://colloquy.info"&gt;Colloquy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colloquy is a nice full-featured open source client. I've used it the
most. However - it doesn't show multiple channels in one window at the
same time, and doesn't keep your place. I've had some problems with
reconnection, where I thought IRC was quiet when I was actually just
disconnected and didn't know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to turn autocorrect off for each room I'm in, which I only
remember after the first time it really annoys me by mangling some
jargon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also some general buggy behavior, and I have a short list of
bugs I'd like to report someday, but I don't have time to fix them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago I hacked my own version of a place marker that I liked, but
I can't remember why it didn't make it in, and of course the code is
lost now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The backlog search looks like it should be powerful, but in my
experience it just doesn't work - it never displays any results. I'm
not sure what the deal is there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As a side note, Colloquy's iPhone app is the only iPhone IRC client
I've used. It seems to work fine, and I don't use it enough to have
specific gripes. Just having to have IRC open on my phone is
guaranteed to annoy me more than the software itself could.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/ERC"&gt;Emacs ERC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current setup is just to run ERC in an emacs window alongside my
code editing.  This has super flexible window splitting and size
management and unbeatable search for your backlog, since it's just
another emacs buffer. There's another nice benefit - if you're writing
about code, emacs' tab-completion for strings across all buffers means
that you can easily autocomplete SomeReallyLongFunctionName in
chats. This saves a lot of typing and cut n' pasting. When you do need
to cut n' paste, it's nicer to do it between emacs buffers than
between apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defaults are not ideal, as usual with emacs you need to dig around
to find a good setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a module to colorize nicknames according to a hash of the
name, so it's easier to tell people apart. Other clients have similar
features but I think I like emacs' the best for some reason - maybe
the palette is nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a module to mark your place that only works if you left the
cursor in the backlog, which is a little weird. It will highlight my
nick when mentioned, but not the whole line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it's open source, I have the same problem as Colloquy, it's
hackable, but I don't really have time for that. And emacs is fun to
hack on, so it's a potentially dangerous time sink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://conceitedsoftware.com/products/linkinus"&gt;Linkinus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a nice client with some minor flaws and a little flakiness. I
liked it but moved on because of minor annoyances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has a kind-of nifty "conversation tracking" feature that tries to
highlight messages in a back-and-forth when you hover over it with the
mouse (but only in the currently selected channel). It's not really
that useful, but I think it could be if pushed further. I'd like to
see more clients try this kind of thing, since separating multiple
concurrent conversations is hard on IRC, and it can be hard to avoid
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets you display multiple channels in one window, but that needs some
improvement. There's just one text-entry field so it's easy to type
something to the wrong channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The split display has some issues. The split channel views don't show
you the channel name anywhere, and in some cases don't even show you
the channel topic, which may or may not be helpful anyway. So it can
take some effort to figure out what channel you're looking at,
especially if there are many of the same people talking on two
channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can save a set of channels as a group, but it doesn't save the
relative sizes of the splits in the group, so if you want to flip
between groups, you'd better be OK with even splits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it only supports vertical splits, so with more than two
channels, you just get a couple unreadably long lines per channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has a very barebones backlog search, but it does work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They've also clearly tried to re-design the account setup / prefs
experience, but I'm not a big fan of an inspector palette - I wanted
to compare settings between two servers and it will only show me one
at a time. This was also the biggest point of flakiness, where some
edits wouldn't commit and I couldn't tell if the settings were being
changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.codeux.com/textual/"&gt;Textual&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Textual is an open-source app
&lt;a href="http://github.com/Codeux/Textual"&gt;(github.com/Codeux/Textual)&lt;/a&gt; that
is for sale on the Mac app store. This is an interesting approach that
I think has some merit - people may still contribute code or bug
fixes, but it's also nice to know that if the app ever gets abandoned,
it could be resurrected. That said, I tried building from source to
enable a quick hack once but the master branch didn't build for me, so
they're not trying to make it easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It lets me hide some admin messages, has automatic &amp;amp;
manual scrollback markers to keep track of what I've missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has a setting to "Track conversations using nickname
highlighting" but I couldn't really tell what it was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also has a pretty barebones search, but again, it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried this for a few days and liked it, but ultimately switched
away, I think mostly because you can't display multiple channels -
there's just one window and it doesn't split up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://mediaware.sk/ware/?page_id=35"&gt;Mango&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't tried Mango. The screenshots in the App Store and feature
listings don't lead me to believe that it's anything significantly
different from the others. I'd be glad to hear from fans, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do you use? Have I missed anything great?&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>apps</category><category>irc</category><category>mac</category><category>review</category><guid>http://michael-mccracken.net/posts/2012/12/mac-irc-clients.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Dec 2012 17:03:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>More out of date links</title><link>http://michael-mccracken.net/posts/2012/10/selected-links.html</link><dc:creator>Michael McCracken</dc:creator><description>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://hammerprinciple.com/therighttool"&gt;Programming Languages · Hammer Principle&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;""In which we explore what modern type systems bring to the table. Imagine an approach to programming where you write down some description of what your code should do, then before running your code you run some automatic tool to see if the code matches the description. That’s Test-driven development, you say!  Actually, this is what you are doing when you use static types in most languages too. Types are a description of the code’s inputs and outputs, and the check ensures that inputs and outputs match up and are used consistently. Modern type systems—such as in Haskell or above—are very flexible, and allow these descriptions to be quite detailed; plus they are not too obtrusive in use and often very helpful.  One point I’ll investigate here is how advances in types are converging with new ideas on testing, to the point where (I claim) the old distinctions are starting to blur and starting to open up exciting new possibilities—hence my suggestion that we need a new word to describe what we’re doing that is free from preconceptions and out-dated thinking.  So put aside your bad experiences from Java, and prepare to be amazed! ""&lt;/p&gt;

This year I've started working on a codebase with a
significant unit test suite for the first time in a while, and good
coverage has definitely come in handy. Now I'm going to share a 
story where a single test did double duty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our filesystem events listening daemon was crashing occasionally on my
system, and I didn't know how to reproduce it. No one else seemed to
be getting these crashes, either. The system was saving a backtrace,
and it was always the same, but I wasn't sure I believed its line
numbers. As a start, I made a guess at the lines that were really
failing, and added a ton of debug dumps to inspect the state. (Since
this daemon is run as root using launchd, it's still easiest to just
use the old printf-n'-stare debug method.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I tried a lot of stuff to poke at it, even leaving Spotify on
overnight in an attempt to recreate the conditions of the bug. No
luck. It seemed like it would only crash when I wasn't trying to get
it to crash - pretty frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally found it, but only after giving up for a while. I checked in
again after working for a while on another project, and hey, lots of
new crashes! With all my extra debug info, I could see what was going
on - a string that couldn't be encoded in UTF-8 was being handled by
some code that assumed it could be. It was a filesystem path with
invalid characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was the path that was killing my daemon? It was a temp file written
by the test suite for the other project. It was a non-utf8 path,
written to test the unicode handling of the GUI, and it had the
wonderful (in retrospect) side effect of poking a bug in the daemon
too. It's so satisfying when you find a bug's cause and it completely explains all the symptoms you were seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One test exercising the unicode handling of multiple projects, now that's coverage!&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>testing</category><guid>http://michael-mccracken.net/posts/2012/10/a-testing-story.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Oct 2012 18:37:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>disposable</title><link>http://michael-mccracken.net/posts/2012/09/disposable.html</link><dc:creator>Michael McCracken</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Computing gadgets don't last long enough. I wanted to write a lot
about this, but since I don't have good answers, I figured I might as
well just pose some questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the time, we're throwing out something that still works, 
because there's something new that works better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working better is great! Faster chips and better screens and cameras
make our lives easier and help us make cool new stuff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to work near people designing processors, so I know it's plenty
hard just to keep that part of the system progressing. And I know that
newer stuff will use less energy, which is great. I know that people
designing data centers think hard about their efficiency, and upgrade
ruthlessly to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how carefully are we considering the impact of getting rid of all
that old equipment? How do we compare whether it's really, globally,
ethically, better to improve speed &amp;amp; efficiency vs. just keep using
old stuff? How do we factor in things like 
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coltan_mining_and_ethics"&gt;resources mined in conflict zones&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently remodeled a house, and among all the advice I read, I
remember this best: "The greenest building material is the one that's
already there." (It was about floors. We put in new bamboo
anyway. That old parquet was awful, but I hope the new stuff stays
there for a hundred years or more.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that designing e.g., a great modern smartphone, is extremely
difficult, even 'only' considering functionality, space and power
constraints. Designing something that small and integrated that could
still be upgraded partially, keeping around parts that still work,
sounds near impossible, but wouldn't it be great? It sounds like a fun
challenge.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>http://michael-mccracken.net/posts/2012/09/disposable.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Sep 2012 15:17:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>'Editor Wars'</title><link>http://michael-mccracken.net/posts/2012/08/editor-wars.html</link><dc:creator>Michael McCracken</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;An idea I'd like to see: Editor Wars, the game of hacking at code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hackers compete on how fast they can complete code editing tasks from
a variety of languages, with results plotted and dissected on a 
web leaderboard. The idea is not to evaluate language understanding or
design, but simply editing skill and speed in the kind of thing that
editor flame wars start over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tasks could be simple refactorings, like renaming a function
throughout a source tree, or extracting code into a method. I'd expect
this would show advantages of specialized refactoring tools in some
IDEs. Other tasks might be more complex, like writing a new set of
functions, a whole class, or adding functions to a class to conform to
a protocol or interface. Good template support and autocomplete might
be an advantage here. Or maybe you want to add conditional debug
logging around a set of functions, with each call having a separate
hardcoded counter value? Surely powerful macros win this task?
Naturally, new tasks could be submitted by the public, and voted on.
Each task would have a "correct" answer, but if you're really clever
you could always suggest a better correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use of extensions and custom macros would be happily encouraged, as
long as you can share what you've used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'd need either an editor plugin or at least something that watches
files efficiently to get the split-second timing your contestants will
demand. Ideally you'd be able to record keystrokes and grab the source
for any macros you call, then the site would be able to show a replay
for the viewing public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It'd be fascinating to learn how other people use your favorite editor
by watching the best of the best compete. Not to mention, just imagine
the forum threads arguing over the graphs from the vast database of
editor timings.&lt;/p&gt;
