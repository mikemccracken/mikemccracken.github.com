Just wasted a lot of time doing a clean reinstall of WordPress to avoid lingering malicious code from the recent worm that's been infecting WP installations - I noticed a new user on my blog that I didn't recognize, and so it looks like I'd been hit.

I thought a couple of times that I'd like to just replace the installation with a static site and move this blog over to something hosted, but it wasn't easy enough that I decided to stick with status quo. I did clean things up and get rid of an old drupal installation that couldn't have been secure in years. The [redirection WP plugin](http://urbangiraffe.com/plugins/redirection/) was a big help in managing this.
