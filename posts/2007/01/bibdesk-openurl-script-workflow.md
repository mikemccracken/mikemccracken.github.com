I love reading about how people use BibDesk. Over on the [bibdesk-users mailing list](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=11760), James Howison [explains in detail](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=11760) how Alex Montgomery's OpenURL script is making him happy. The short version: "Zero typing of the bibliographic details :)"

As he explains, you can find some great scripts for BibDesk on the wiki at [BibDesk Applescripts](http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/BibDesk_Applescripts).
