I've been behind the times on weblog technology for a while now, so when I noticed that [pair](http://www.pair.com) had a pre-packaged [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) install I could use on my account, I thought I'd take the opportunity to move from [Blapp](http://blapp.sf.net), which I love because it is my own code, to [MarsEdit](http://ranchero.com/marsedit/), which does more and doesn't need me to maintain it.

I've updated my [Feedburner feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/Michael-mccrackennet) to the new URL: [michael-mccracken.net/wp/](http://michael-mccracken.net/wp/), but the old weblog URL [http://michael-mccracken.net/blog/](http://michael-mccracken.net/blog/) is still around for permanence.
