  <div class="entry-content"><p>I use subversion, and won&#8217;t switch to something newer for a while, so it&#8217;s worth looking at how to polish that old hammer. I&#8217;m used to using the command line svn, or emacs. But recently I decided to try out a few of the nice GUI clients that are around, including <a href="http://versionsapp.com/">Versions</a>, <a href="http://zigzig.com/">ZigVersion</a> and <a href="http://www.zennaware.com/cornerstone/">Cornerstone</a>.</p>

<p>Of these, the only one that&#8217;s polished enough to lure me away from emacs and seems to support my favorite mode of working is Cornerstone, and it still gets it a little wrong.</p>

<p>I like to write log comments while looking at (and scrolling through) the diffs for the files I&#8217;m committing. This means I want a text field for writing log comments on the same screen as the diffs, that isn&#8217;t modal, and doesn&#8217;t stop me from moving around between multiple diffs.</p>

<p>As far as I could tell, I couldn&#8217;t get the comment field and the diff display shown together in Versions, and while I could in ZigVersion, that app had a subpar diff display and lacked polish overall, missing key shortcuts where I&#8217;d expect them, for instance. Cornerstone almost lets me do what I want, but it displays the comment field in a modal sheet, so I have to cancel to change which diff I&#8217;m looking at.</p>

<p>This is easy in emacs, but I like a nicer diff GUI. Am I just missing something? This feels like a natural workflow, so it seems strange that no clients support it well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Alex Payne&#8217;s recent post <a href="http://al3x.net/2009/01/31/against-everything-buckets.html">The case against everything buckets</a> makes a strong point in favor of using the filesystem for filing. To paraphrase: If your problem is that you have a bunch of files you need to search through, and possibly tag, then the filesystem and Spotlight are probably closer to solving your problem than you expect.</p>

<p>I enjoyed reading his post, because I like rules of thumb for simple design, and one of my favorites is &#8220;why not just use files?&#8221; - there are often reasons to do something else, but the filesystem is faster, more reliable, and more open than anything you&#8217;re likely to come up with on the first try. So you&#8217;d better be sure you&#8217;re not just poorly reimplementing it.</p>

<p>Buzz Andersen has a <a href="http://log.scifihifi.com/post/76989703/everything-buckets">thorough response</a>, centering on the fact that VoodooPad is a very useful app. Certainly I agree - I use it all the time, and its hyperlinking sets it apart from other notes apps (and the filesystem). So yes, VoodooPad is a Good Idea.</p>

<p>But is VoodooPad really an &#8220;Everything Bucket&#8221;? I&#8217;m not sold - you can use it to store PDFs and images and other files, but it really focuses on pages, and those files are just attachments to your pages. I see it as a notes app. I think if your problem is keeping notes - with images if necessary, linking between them, and searching those notes, then VoodooPad is clearly better than the filesystem. But you don&#8217;t have to put everything else in there too.</p>

<p>I agree with Alex that I don&#8217;t want one program to keep everything in a proprietary database. I like apps that keep my files as files. (like <a href="http://c-command.com/eaglefiler/">EagleFiler</a>.) But I do want layers on top of the filesystem - you wouldn&#8217;t want to use just files for email, for example.</p>

<p>The only solution that&#8217;s always bad is the solution to someone else&#8217;s problem.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve written here before about text fields, particularly the problem of having a good-looking &#8216;display&#8217; mode and a separate &#8216;edit&#8217; mode for data you don&#8217;t edit so often, like in AddressBook.</p>

<p>The most recent version of iCal decided that events are write-once-read-many as well. You now have to use cmd-E to get into edit mode, while cmd-I just gives you a small display mode.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m mostly OK with that, although I find I edit events about as often as I look at their info windows - after editing I usually just deal with alarms, not the events themselves. The casual glance at the time and title is always enough - I think either you&#8217;re looking at the time and title or you&#8217;re editing. I don&#8217;t see the appeal in the new &#8216;info-only&#8217; mode (if it&#8217;s actually new - it seems new.)</p>

<p>However, the change does highlight the jumble of editable text fields and text-like fields in the edit window:
<a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/wp2/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/pastedgraphic-1.tiff"><img src="http://michael-mccracken.net/wp2/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/pastedgraphic-1.tiff" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/wp2/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/pastedgraphic.tiff"><img src="http://michael-mccracken.net/wp2/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/pastedgraphic.tiff" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The &#8220;Add Attendees&#8221; link and the &#8220;None&#8221; placeholder for url act the same - you click on them, and enter text.
One&#8217;s a link and one&#8217;s mute gray text. Why?
For my part, I think the gray text is too understated, and the link is too garish.</p>

<p>There are other differences: you can tab to the &#8220;url&#8221; field, but you can&#8217;t tab to &#8220;attendees&#8221;&#8230; until you add one, then you can. Once you click on either of them, the url field pops up a plain white raised NSTextField, but the attendees field is sunken and translucent, apparently an NSTokenField?</p>

<p>Both of the blue links could also be buttons. I&#8217;m still not completely sold on replacing buttons with links, but I can understand the trend. I think a small plus-sign button would be fine for &#8220;Add File&#8221;, though, and &#8220;Attendees&#8221; ought to be a text field. Why force the user to use the mouse when adding data to an event?</p>

<p>All in all, I think the &#8220;Add Attendees&#8221; link/field is pretty strange. I&#8217;m curious if I missing a precedent somewhere.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometimes progress on a project for me consists of a few short bursts of activity in between stretches of waiting for some long-running thing to complete so I can figure out what I need to do with it next.</p>

<p>Because I always have more than one project going, I don&#8217;t actually wait much. I just switch workspaces and try to make progress on the next thing. If I can&#8217;t make progress on anything immediate, I&#8217;ll end up checking email or looking up something for a side project.</p>

<p>This kind of multitasking is inefficient, but inevitable when I might have to wait for 20 minutes or more for a compute job or a compile to finish.</p>

<p>The problem with this approach is that the things I&#8217;m waiting for often finish while I&#8217;m off doing something else, and if I get too involved, the low-priority research or emails will eat up my day while the high-priority work sits waiting for me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve attacked this problem in the past when using OS X with <a href="gr">growl</a>, but I can&#8217;t call growlnotify from remote systems. However, I just found <a href="dzen">dzen</a> for X Windows, a lightweight notification display utility that compiles easily on every system I&#8217;ve tried, and works remotely with ssh X forwarding.</p>

<p>I wrote a simple script called <code>go</code>, which just executes its arguments and runs <code>dzen</code> when it&#8217;s done. Now I type (for example) <code>go make</code> and I can switch over to something else, confident that I&#8217;ll see a big popup window letting me know when I can get back to working on my highest priority project.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s basically the entire <code>go</code> script:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/ksh
echo $@
$@
echo $@ completed on `hostname` \
 | dzen2 -p -h 64 -bg darkblue
</code></pre>

<p>It&#8217;s simple but it&#8217;s working great for me. I&#8217;ve tried some improvements like randomizing window placement to avoid overlapping notifications, but the simple version above really does all I need.</p>

<p>Finally, a couple of details. zsh always seems to want to spell-check &#8216;go&#8217;, so I really named it &#8216;~/bin/executeAndNotify.sh&#8217; and just aliased &#8216;go&#8217; to that.
Also, I&#8217;ve found it can mess with shell quoting as is, so sometimes I have to do <code>'somecommand ; go echo done'</code>. If someone has a tip on getting the quoting right in the script, I&#8217;d love to hear it. The problem crops up when you try something like &#8216;go make CC=&#8221;cc -g&#8221;&#8217; - the quotes don&#8217;t make it through.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Daniel Jalkut just <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/481/it-should-be-free">wrote about</a> a desktop bookmarking app called <a href="http://codesorcery.net/pukka/">Pukka</a>, which despite being apparently nice enough to warrant a positive review, was simple enough that Leo Laporte wasn&#8217;t comfortable just saying it cost $15. I felt like adding to the discussion after a few commenters described the app as trivial - in one case saying that any good programmer could write it in two hours.</p>

<p>This bothered me, so I downloaded Pukka and gave it a try. I was curious to see if it was indeed trivial.</p>

<p>While it definitely doesn&#8217;t seem like the most feature-rich program up front, there&#8217;s a lot of stuff in there - it works with more than one bookmarking site, it integrates with RSS readers, uses the OS X keychain, includes Bonjour discovery of nearby users, and has AppleScript support.</p>

<p>Further, it shows attention to detail. Although I may not agree with some of Justin&#8217;s UI design choices, it&#8217;s clear that he spent time thinking about bookmarking workflow. I know in some of my projects, just pondering design choices takes hours - drawing mockups, and trying things out.</p>

<p>End-user app development isn&#8217;t just programming, and programming isn&#8217;t just typing.</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s fair to say that that although you might be able to retype the code by hand in a few hours, Pukka represents a good chunk of serious work. I&#8217;m sure the mac developers in the audience will agree - Applescript support alone is almost guaranteed to be more than two hours of work.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m glad that there&#8217;s a market for small apps and small developers, and I hope downwards price pressure from large subsidized or bundled apps doesn&#8217;t kill that off.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>From Flying Meat, <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad">VoodooPad</a> 3.5 is out.
(<a href="http://www.flyingmeat.com/fs/flystashweb.cgi/2dc35f78-ac3e-01dc-01d4-c0cbe4c4bd91">release notes here</a>).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a solid update, including welcome image-editor integration and more. I thought I&#8217;d point out my favorite feature in the release notes:</p>

<p>&#8220;You can now edit pages and sort the results in the search window (woo!).&#8221;</p>

<p>I like this because it matches a kind of manual refactoring habit I picked up with Project Builder / XCode&#8217;s excellent &#8220;Find in Project…&#8221; window - I search for a keyword that marks places I need to look at and edit the files right in the search window. (Note: <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Other-Repeating-Search.html">&#8216;occur-mode&#8217; and kin</a> are a powerful way to do the same in Emacs…)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a powerful habit if you plan for it, by using comments in code to keep track of what you&#8217;ve touched when making a lot of cross-cutting changes, like <code># @addsearch</code> Then when you think you&#8217;re done with a change, you can run a quick search to see if you forgot to fix anything.</p>

<p>Sometimes in VoodooPad notes, I&#8217;ll write in placeholders like that comment when I don&#8217;t have a bit of information yet, and now I can follow my trails the same way I do in code.</p>

<p>Thanks, Gus!</p>

<time datetime="2008-02-01T03:07:28-08:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 1<span>st</span>, 2008</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been hacking around with <a href="http://pyobjc.sf.net">PyObjC</a>, the Python-ObjC/Cocoa bridge recently, and it&#8217;s quickly becoming my favorite way to write Cocoa apps. It&#8217;s really natural to mix Python idioms with Cocoa objects.</p>

<p>The latest version of PyObjC is 2.0, it&#8217;s installed by default on OS X 10.5, and XCode now includes templates for starting a PyObjC project. There&#8217;s even code autocomplete in XCode for PyObjC and IB integration, so aside from some smart-indenting issues, writing PyObjC in XCode is almost as natural as writing in ObjC.</p>

<p>I thought I&#8217;d post a few nice shortcuts and tips here.</p>

<p>You can use tuples for NSRect/Range/Point, for instance, this -</p>

<pre><code>r = NSInsetRect(((0, 0) ,
                 (100, 100)),
                10, 10)
</code></pre>

<p>creates this NSRect -</p>

<pre><code>NSRect origin=
       size=&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Passing python arrays as NSArray instances (and dictionaries as NSDictionaries) works great, but sometimes you need to pass a C array. The Python &#8216;array&#8217; module handles that nicely:</p>

<pre><code>import array
g = NSGradient.alloc().
   initWithColors_locations_colorSpace_(
    [NSColor.whiteColor(),
     NSColor.blackColor()],   

    array.array('f', [0.0, 1.0]),
    NSColorSpace.deviceRGBColorSpace())
</code></pre>

<p>ObjC selectors are just python strings in PyObjC.</p>

<pre><code>defNC.addObserver_selector_name_object_(self,
  'windowDidResize:',
  NSWindowDidResizeNotification,
  self)
# or
self.performSelectorOnMainThread_withObject_waitUntilDone_('doIt:', None, False)
# or
if o.respondsToSelector_("fun:"): return o.fun_(a)
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, something that comes in handy when working with KVC, the  &#8216;_&#8217; method now defined on NSObjects in PyObjC:</p>

<pre><code>o = 
print o._.myKey
o._.myKey = 44
# is equivalent to:
print o.valueForKey_('myKey')
o.setValue_forKey_(44, 'myKey')
</code></pre>

<p>That last example is straight from the <a href="http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/NEWS-2.0.html">NEWS page</a>, where lots of other useful info can be found.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been looking around for some more detailed information about the &#8220;Site Reliability Engineering&#8221; positions at Google.
Apparently the role is a real mix of very large-scale system administration, planning and automation.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve collected some links to public info about the job.</p>

<p>The Google channel has <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y31STIrwtlk">a promotional video</a> from one engineer about the role - he tells a quick story about being on call to monitor and address problems with Google talk.</p>

<p>A set of <a href="http://www.ukuug.org/events/spring2007/programme/ThatCouldntHappenToUs.pdf">slides from a talk by James Youngman</a> at the UK Unix &amp; Open Systems User&#8217;s Group gives a good description of the general task, and dives deeper into two specific examples - powering down failed disks, and protecting data with checksums, exploring how straightforward ideas can explode at scale.
(These slides also have potentially the best proprietary-information disclaimer I&#8217;ve ever seen: &#8220;This has been written entirely in ASCII. No EBCDIC or animal fat.&#8221;)</p>

<p><a href="http://sysadmin.miniconf.org/2006/pollmann_google_lightning_talk.ppt">Here</a> is another set of slides with a quick overview, from a &#8216;lightning talk&#8217;.</p>

<p>A sampling of what Google SRE engineers put in their public resumes about their job includes quite a span - from troubleshooting mission critical services to writing automation software (in Python).</p>

<p>And finally, an <a href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/03/hiring-lake-wobegon-strategy.html">interesting post from 2006</a> about the theory behind Google&#8217;s hiring strategy, summarized as &#8220;only hire candidates who are above the mean of your current employees&#8221;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://twitter.com/dacort">Damon Cortesi</a> just shared a handy script for grabbing your tweets and compiling some stats about when you post to twitter and who you reply to.</p>

<p>His script generates a list of numbers and included a Numbers template to paste them into. Since I don&#8217;t have Numbers, I&#8217;ve modified <a href="http://dcortesi.com/2007/12/27/twitter-stats/">his script</a> to write a file that can be read by <a href="http://gnuplot.info">gnuplot</a>, and wrote a basic gnuplot script to output an SVG file version of the stats.</p>

<p>While I was at it, I changed it so it no longer counts &#8220;@someone&#8221; separately from &#8220;@someone:&#8221;.</p>

<p>Both scripts are right here - <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/twitter/gnuplot_twitterstats.tgz">gnuplot_twitterstats.tgz</a></p>

<p>It uses gnuplot 4.2, which you can get on OS X with <a href="http://www.macports.org/">macports</a> using <code>port install gnuplot +no_x11'</code>. (Or it&#8217;s a pretty easy build on its own, see the <a href="http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/download.html">gnuplot download page</a> )</p>

<p>Here are my stats:
Sorry, it looks like your browser doesn&#8217;t support SVG. You&#8217;re really not missing much.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My favorite apps, the ones that slip easily into everyday use and stick there, just start with plain text and add some extra sauce. <a href="http://voodoopad.com">VoodooPad</a> is a great example, and Hog Bay Software&#8217;s new app <a href="http://hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper">TaskPaper</a> is, too.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve used both <a href="http://kinkless.com/kgtd">kgtd</a> and <a href="http://bargiel.home.pl/iGTD/">iGTD</a>, and played around with a few others. I came closest to sticking with a system using kgtd, but switched to iGTD because manually syncing kgtd got old.</p>

<p>All the extra <em>stuff</em> in iGTD was appealing, but I left tasks in the inbox for weeks, and never reviewed much of my vast forest of projects. I eventually fell back into tending short lists in Stickies, with titles like &#8221;<strong>NOW</strong>:&#8221; and &#8221;<strong>BY TUESDAY!</strong>:&#8221;.</p>

<p>When I moved those Stickies lists into TaskPaper, all I had to do was copy and paste - it uses the same format I do when I get lazy, and that has to be a good sign. I haven&#8217;t found a reason to jot a note somewhere else yet.</p>

<p>Moving tasks from iGTD was more sobering. Half those &#8220;next actions&#8221; had been done for weeks, and the other half were clearly scheduled for next Neversday. As Merlin Mann pointed out, <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2007/06/04/getting-ready-for-omnifocus">switching apps is a good excuse for a real review</a>.</p>

<p>TaskPaper adds automatic formatting, tabs, search, and a bit of hyperlinking to plain text.
Tasks are lines that start with a dash, and can be tagged by starting any word with an at-sign. Clicking a tag starts a search for that tag. I use them in a couple of ways - as contexts, and for scheduling. They can really be anything that makes sense as a visible search keyword.</p>

<p>I have been keeping a few tabs open - one to edit tasks, and a couple others with live searches to look at what&#8217;s on my plate. When I want to schedule something, I&#8217;ll tag it as @now or @tomorrow - I have those two as open tabs, and as I work I keep the @now tab open.
Other tabs come and go to look at contexts, like @email or @errand.</p>

<p>I like that the tags can be part of the sentence, so I don&#8217;t have to tab through a bunch of controls to set tags - I just write something like &#8216;@email Bob @home&#8217;&#8230; easy.</p>

<p>I also set up an inbox project (by typing &#8220;Inbox:&#8221;, naturally) to collect notes quickly, and that&#8217;s worked pretty well so far.</p>

<p>As with any 1.0, there&#8217;s some room for improvement. It&#8217;s not very scriptable, but it is plain text, so it could be worked around. Quicksilver integration was important with both kGTD and iGTD, and I&#8217;m not sure yet if I&#8217;ll really miss that here.
It can clean up tasks marked as done into an &#8220;Archive&#8221; project, but doesn&#8217;t yet note when they were finished, if that kind of thing matters to you. Finally, I&#8217;m not sure what the best way to sync with other devices would be, but there is a <a href="http://hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper_web">web interface</a> in development - maybe that would be a good iPhone option.</p>

<p>TaskPaper is a solid, clear, and nicely minimalist app. Over the week I&#8217;ve been using it, it has made keeping to-dos in one place too easy to avoid, and added just enough functionality to sort through them without being distracting.</p>

<p>Note:
When I downloaded the 1.0 release, I found a conflict with TextExtras and wrote a <a href="http://hogbaysoftware.com/forums/taskpaper/topics/294_Archive_bug_in_1_22_">bug report</a>. In reply, Jesse sent me a complimentary license. Nice guy. I was going to write about it anyway, but I thought I should mention that I got it for free, as a surprise.</p>
