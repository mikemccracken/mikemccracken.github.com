My shared links for July 27th through July 30th:






  * [45 Days.](http://www.pixelatedimage.com/blog/2011/07/45-days/) - "fill the days with little things first and there won't be room for the big ones"

An hour a day = 45 days a year. The kind of thing you just need to keep re-hearing every so often.


  * ["Computer Chess" by Andrew Bujalski - United States Artists - Great art forms here](http://www.unitedstatesartists.org/project/computer_chess) - 



> So all these years later I'm trying to make a very odd movie indeed, about computer chess programmers circa 1980, and perhaps deep down it's my attempt to vicariously peek into the fantasy braniac life I ought to have pursued as a kid. It happens to be a fascinating era for the field. As computers were exploding into the public sphere, and regular folks were just getting used to seeing them in the workplace, or home, a group of geniuses at the vanguard of the technology were trying to teach it what seemed like an almost unimaginable skill--could these machines, these glorified calculators, ever conquer the human world champion in chess? Obviously a human being would have to be a genius to be the world chess champ, so if they could get a computer to do it, the computer would have to acquire a kind of genius, right?






  * [Moom * Many Tricks](http://manytricks.com/moom/) - OS X window organizer. might come in handy on a big big screen...


  * [Schulz's Beethoven: Schroeder's Muse](http://absadmin.users.sonic.net/schulz/pages/page1.html) - An online museum exhibit of the significance of Beethoven in Charles Schulz' Peanuts. Sparky was a real fan.


  * [Clementson's Blog: Mac OS X for Emacs Users](http://bc.tech.coop/blog/060620.html) - How to make os x as emacs-keybinding friendly as possible. (maybe old, certainly my isearch plugin hasn't been tested on lion, at least by me...)
