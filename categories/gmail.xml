&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://beets.radbox.org/"&gt;beets: the music geek's media organizer&lt;/a&gt; - The purpose of beets is to get your music collection right once and for all. It catalogs your collection, automatically improving its metadata as it goes using the MusicBrainz database. (It also downloads cover art for albums it imports.) Then it provides a bouquet of tools for manipulating and accessing your music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because beets is designed as a library, it can do almost anything you can imagine for your music collection. Via plugins, beets becomes a panacea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embed and extract album art from files' tags.
Listen to your library with a music player that speaks the MPD protocol and works with a staggering variety of interfaces.
Fetch lyrics for all your songs from databases on the Web.
Manage your MusicBrainz music collection.
Analyze music files' metadata from the command line.
Clean up crufty tags left behind by other, less-awesome tools.
Browse your music library graphically through a Web browser and play it in any browser that supports HTML5 Audio.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>apps</category><category>framework</category><category>gmail</category><category>haskell</category><category>links</category><category>maps</category><category>music</category><category>ocd</category><category>pinboard-links</category><category>plugins</category><category>policy</category><category>programming</category><category>ranking</category><category>score</category><category>statistics</category><category>tagging</category><category>terrorism</category><category>web</category><guid>http://michael-mccracken.net/2012/04/links-haskell-music-ocd-tools-terrorism-probability-for-ranking-things/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Apr 2012 23:16:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Handling Reference Emails</title><link>http://michael-mccracken.net/2011/04/handling-reference-emails/</link><dc:creator>Michael McCracken</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you need to refer to your email. (I've written about this &lt;a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/2007/06/the-read-once-email-client-and-reference-emails/"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's to integrate comments from a bunch of people while you're editing a report, or it's a set of mails with instructions for something, like how to configure &amp;amp; install a source code package or submit expense reports in the new system. These emails could all be in one thread, but just as often it's a few mails spread throughout several threads and scattered in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good mail client should make it easy to keep arbitrary groups of messages visible for reference. Since they're reference emails, you're just reading them, and the display shouldn't really be more than the text of the mail. You should be able to fit a few of these on screen without overlapping what you're actually working on, and you don't need a big toolbar with a bunch of actions that won't be happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I'm doing something in another app, I want to arrange my reference mails in an empty part of the screen, then not click back over to the mail client until I'm ready to close them. The faster it is to set up this display and get on with things, the better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at how a few existing clients support this kind of thing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Gmail&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easy to open a conversation and refer to it, and you can hide the body of messages that aren't relevant. But you can't move things around, so if it's a really long thread, you might be in for some scrolling. If you want to refer to more than one thread, you will have to open each in its own window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Apple Mail&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of its lack of a conversation-style thread view, the way to do this is to just open separate windows for each message. You can't look at a single thread in one window - have to open N windows for N messages. Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Mail is what I use most often, when I have this problem I always end up with a flock of windows, and lots of clicking, scrolling and cmd-tabbing around to see what I need, followed by looking at all my open windows and trying not to close any unrelated drafts or accidentally send or delete something important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Postbox &amp;amp; Thunderbird&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience with Postbox is similar to, but a little worse than GMail.
In Postbox, there's a thread view where I can hide uninteresting messages like GMail, but if I want to pop the thread out into a separate window, I can't - only single messages can be popped into separate windows. I can make tabs with the thread view by double-clicking on a thread, but I can't figure out how to get a new window. Of course, if I need to see multiple emails at once, tabs are no good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thunderbird is basically the same, except at least in 3.0.4, the default view when you select a thread is less useful than Postbox's - it looks more like a debug dump of the message's text than a well-designed display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;MailMate&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MailMate is similar to Postbox &amp;amp; Thunderbird - except that you get a nice linear conversation-style view with any selection, not just a single thread. (Postbox has a nice view but only for a thread, and TBird shows you any selection but not a nice view.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, as with those others, the linear conversation view can't be popped into its own reading-oriented window, and it's strictly linear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think any of the clients I looked at have a good solution for this. Is that a problem? Is this actually important? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think so. I bet if you think about when you actually look at an email, it's usually one of three times - when you first read it, as you write a reply to it, and when you're searching for it later. In both of the second two cases, I've found that I often have more than one mail or thread that I want to look at while I write or do something in another app, and a dedicated view to support that would be great. I could search through just those messages. I could minimize or move them all at once. Just think of the possibilities!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if it's easy to keep this set of emails around for later reference without cluttering up my screen in the meantime - and without actually moving the messages into some separate folder on my server - that'd be really great. Because you always have another expense report to file, and really, who wants to memorize &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; procedure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, as a journalist I'm sure he gets &lt;em&gt;tons&lt;/em&gt; more email than average people, and he can't afford to just ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>email</category><category>eudora</category><category>gmail</category><category>tidbits</category><guid>http://michael-mccracken.net/2011/04/adam-engst-on-gmail-at-tidbits/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2011 00:15:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Filters: GMail</title><link>http://michael-mccracken.net/2010/06/filters-gmail/</link><dc:creator>Michael McCracken</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;How well does GMail let me create filters to handle heavy traffic lists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GMail is not perfect, but it's got the workflow down right.
When I want to add a filter, I am probably looking at a message that I want the filter to match. So GMail's "Filter messages like this" command is a great match. They also know about lists, and they auto-populate the search command for the filter with the "list:list@foo.com" style search. This works out pretty great, and I've been using GMail for lists for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works to divert the flood out of my inbox, but it can also mean that for lists that aren't related to my job, I have basically unsubscribed to the list - out of sight, out of mind.
I sometimes add filters to automatically "star" conversations I'm likely to want to look at, but that's not the best choice - it overloads the meaning of the star, and I'd rather see either tags that aren't full labels (and don't clutter up my label list) or a some other flag-like bit that is only set by filters to say when something might be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>filters</category><category>gmail</category><guid>http://michael-mccracken.net/2010/06/filters-gmail/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2010 20:57:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Conversation View &amp; Keeping up with Lists</title><link>http://michael-mccracken.net/2010/04/conversation-view-keeping-up-with-lists/</link><dc:creator>Michael McCracken</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Here's a set of screenshots that show how conversation view can help keeping up with a public list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been subscribed to the LLVM-dev mailing list for years in GMail, and for about a week in my mikechecksmail test account. I'm not active in the LLVM project - it's just something I want to check in on occasionally. (For a while I had a filter that popped up any mention of Fortran). So when I check in, I want to skim the threads and read anything that's interesting. Usually that means I'm finding a thread that's already pretty long and I'm reading the whole thread from the beginning the first time I see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm interested to hear if that's not how you read public high-traffic lists - do you try to keep up with all the threads as they come in? I did that for a while, but it's hard to keep up with and probably isn't actually your job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with that workflow in mind, how do our clients fare?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GMail&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In GMail, when you click on a new thread (aka "conversation") you get the messages all on one page, starting with the earliest - perfect for reading from the beginning. This shot shows the first couple of messages in a medium size thread:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l1ai4mO4Al1qz505e.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's pretty good about handling quotes, too. If you're reading through an entire thread at a time, it's nice to have quoted text collapsed so you don't end up scrolling past the same paragraphs over and over. Of course, quoted text can be critical for understanding the new text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;show&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;quoted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Yes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;show&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;quoted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;No&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But in my judgement, barring some natural language analysis, the best default is to collapse and let the user click to expand quotes when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you return to a thread and it has new messages, it'll collapse the ones you've seen before, handy to get a quick update:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l1ajpwBp531qz505e.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Postbox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you select "Show Conversations" in the "View" menu, Postbox shows something like a conversation-view when you select an entire thread. If you don't have that option on, or you select more than one message in any other way - like shift-or-command-clicking multiple messages, you get a blank content view. Not very useful, but a minor point - after all, GMail doesn't really show the list in the same page as the content anyway, so they've avoided that design problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major problem with Postbox's conversation view - for this list-catchup task - is that it sorts the messages with the newest ones at the top. This is exactly the wrong thing for reading a whole thread, and I couldn't find a way to change this sort order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what it looks like on that same thread:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l1ajxnHkKi1qz505e.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple other minor nitpicks - the info pane with the sender and links on the right-hand side only shows its info for the most recent message - if you want that info for another message, you have to select just that message in the list view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you revisit the thread, it marks every message as read, and there's no way to see what's new:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l1ajzroxSb1qz505e.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're still looking at the thread when new messages in that thread come in, it'll give you a nice alert and lets you refresh the view, but then the problem is still there - it's up to you to see what's new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thunderbird&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thunderbird 3 has a summary view, but it's not thread-centric.
It just shows the sender, date and first few lines (smashed together without newlines) of each message you've selected. If you select a thread, it's kind of like a conversation view, but if you select multiple unrelated messages, it'll just show the messages in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what that looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l1ak9yEo0u1qz505e.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly there's some room for improvement there. I won't pick on it too much, except to say that smashing the text together for a summary makes this view basically useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Mail&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Mail doesn't really try to give you a summary of a thread or a conversation view - it'll show which mails are new, but then you have to click through to an individual view of each message. Here's what it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l1akg4XWv41qz505e.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't sloppy like Thunderbird's view, but it's not very useful either. For this and other reasons, keeping up with public mailing lists in Apple Mail is pretty painful. That's why I moved most of my list subscriptions over to GMail a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>apple-mail</category><category>conversation-view</category><category>gmail</category><category>lists</category><category>postbox</category><category>thunderbird</category><guid>http://michael-mccracken.net/2010/04/conversation-view-keeping-up-with-lists/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2010 19:57:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Public List Tests: The Firehose</title><link>http://michael-mccracken.net/2010/04/public-list-tests-the-firehose/</link><dc:creator>Michael McCracken</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I'm signing up for a couple of public mailing lists to test how the clients help me handle the firehose of potentially-relevant emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years now, I've used GMail exclusively for public lists, because the conversation view maps really well to how I like to scan most lists - I like to see what new threads have started, and only read individual messages if the topic is interesting. I also tend to look at a thread if someone smart has weighed in, so if a client helps me pick that out, it's good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In GMail, it only shows three or so of the people in any thread, so I have resorted to filters that star any thread where smart people are talking. I don't love that solution, though, since I also use stars to manually flag something as important, and I'd rather not mix things up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've signed up for one low-traffic list (&lt;a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pyobjc-dev"&gt;PyObjC-dev&lt;/a&gt;) and one higher-traffic list (&lt;a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/llvmdev"&gt;LLVM-dev&lt;/a&gt;), since different traffic levels are different problems. A really high-traffic list can really test a client's filtering and thread display design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these lists are &lt;a href="http://list.org/"&gt;Mailman&lt;/a&gt; lists, which is a very broadly used system and it's what I'm used to. I'm open to hearing about other kinds of lists with different features that might change things, though - leave a comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now I'm starting with digests off, which I like because I prefer to see things by thread instead of by date. Some clients do unpack digests automatically, so I might test that out sometime, but I think that a client should just control when it shows you bulk mail instead of just asking the list to only send it once a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll report here as the traffic builds and we'll see how each client handles it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>conversation-view</category><category>gmail</category><category>lists</category><guid>http://michael-mccracken.net/2010/04/public-list-tests-the-firehose/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Apr 2010 17:27:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Unread counts</title><link>http://michael-mccracken.net/2010/04/unread-counts/</link><dc:creator>Michael McCracken</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;One common misguided feature of mail clients is putting an attention-grabbing red badge somewhere showing the count of unread messages in your inbox (or some other folder).
It's worst if it's on the dock badge and you don't hide the dock - then there's no way short of quitting the app to completely avoid this visual interruption. Sure you can just ignore it, but why should you have to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick survey of the three main mail clients I've been using shows that they all have some way of putting unread counts in your line of sight, and only Apple Mail (I use v 3.6 on OS X 10.5) really lets you shut it up - you can tell it not to badge the dock at all. If you had a subset of mail that really does need to interrupt you, you can also restrict the unread count to a particular smart mailbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="AppleMail Quiet Prefs" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l07f5b5Zez1qz505e.tiff"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smart mailbox feature is interesting. It's hard to imagine what kind of email is just important enough to show the unread count for, but not important enough for a more obvious alert. I'm sure the feature comes from a different viewpoint on mail - perhaps the idea is that you'll never read all your messages, so you want to see a count of how many "important" ones you need to read. I think that's just treating a symptom, though, honestly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other end of the scale, Thunderbird 3 has no way that I can find to turn off the dock badge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TBird dock badge" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l07fezvyeh1qz505e.tiff"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They do give you a way to make it more annoying, though - you can have the dock icon bounce for every new mail! I can't think of any good reason for that, except that at some point when the dock was new, it was fun to make things bounce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tbird quiet prefs" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l07fj1MSaz1qz505e.tiff"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, GMail - I take my GMail more or less straight-up, in a dedicated browser app with no extra frills, that I wrote in 2006 (see post &lt;a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/2006/05/webmail-is-not-web-browsing/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; ). I understand that apps like &lt;a href="http://mailplaneapp.com"&gt;Mailplane&lt;/a&gt; add some nice desktop integration, and multiple account support, but I don't really need that stuff. So, assuming a basic straight-up GMail, it has no dock badge, but it does show an unread count in the title bar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="gmail unread" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l07fvlL0011qz505e.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that'll show up in some menus and on mouse-over in Exposé, it's really not a big deal. I'd say that GMail (in the browser) and Apple Mail are about the same in terms of visual distraction, once you change the prefs in Mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd prefer that an email app didn't do anything to make all unread messages look like something important you need to fix. If I'm going to check the mail, I'll notice the messages. If I'm not about to check the mail, I don't want to know. I think this is best for everyone, too - like the insistence on filing vs. searching, it's an outdated habit from a time when email volumes were lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either a message is important enough for a major interruption - a pop-up window with a beep, for instance - or it's OK to let it sit for a while. The unread status alone is a poor substitute for "important", and we should move past it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>gmail</category><category>mail.app</category><category>quiet</category><category>thunderbird-3</category><guid>http://michael-mccracken.net/2010/04/unread-counts/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 Apr 2010 17:11:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>HTML mail is here to stay, so a client needs to handle it well.

Since images in HTML mail are security problems, a good client won't load them until you say so - and should also let you white-list some senders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GMail does this well enough, with two links - one to show the images in a message once, and another to whitelist the sender. I'd say that's about the best you can ask for. If you want to remove a sender from the whitelist, it's a little obscure - you have to find an email from them and there's a link in the details that says "Don't display from now on."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="GMail image whitelist" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kzulamJin51qz505e.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting thing is that this is a separate list of addresses from your Contacts (which in GMail, includes every address in every email by default).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thunderbird starts off with basically the same interface as GMail. They show a big loud bar that alerts you to the missing images, as if you couldn't tell. You can press a button to load it once, or click a link (why not another button?) to whitelist the sender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tbird image whitelist" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kzulcqQ6PG1qz505e.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where we go a little haywire, though - all I want to do is whitelist the sender for images, but Thunderbird throws up a sheet asking me for all kinds of contact info - now the sending email is in my address book. So I end up with a bunch of noreply addresses in a group in my address book called "Personal Address Book." Thanks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tbird addrbook" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kzull57mRg1qz505e.tiff"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a whitelist just for image display that's separate from the address book is the way to go - it seems more natural. An address book seems like something I should control manually. Ideally, in a desktop mail client on OS X, the client's address book is just the system's Address Book DB - so that other apps can use the info. And since that's system-wide data, you really don't want a client just dumping everything in there.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>addressbook</category><category>gmail</category><category>html</category><category>image</category><category>thunderbird-3</category><category>whitelist</category><guid>http://michael-mccracken.net/2010/03/html-mail-is-here-to-stay-so-a-client-needs-to-handle-it-well-since-images-in-html-mail-are-securi/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Mar 2010 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Let's talk some more email philosophy.

An email client should help you quickly get through new emails, on your schedule, and turn them into whatever you need them to be once you've read them. Then it should shut up until you call it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I'll point at &lt;a href="http://inboxzero.com/"&gt;Merlin Mann&lt;/a&gt; as my original inspiration, and if you want to hear more about the reasons behind this line of thought, go listen to his recent podcast appearances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further - I'm against unread counts, against new-mail sounds, against pop-up notification of new mail. I can't think of a job you could have where there's a good reason you should be interrupted by an email client for every new message. Sure, some things are important and ought to interrupt you - but there are a host of better technologies for urgent communication - IM, SMS, Phone calls, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm for search, against filing. If you're shuffling email into folders, part of what you're doing is building an index. Computers know how to index text, and they can do it faster and more completely than you can, so stop wasting your time - especially if you're just filing it according to data that's already in the message, like sender or date. If your filing system is adding some information to each message, then a client should just let you add that info quickly and then index it for you. Not enough clients do this well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, like many people, I work at a big company that runs its own email infrastructure and won't be giving control to Google any time soon. This means that while GMail is an interesting case study and a useful option for personal email, I need to use another client for most of my email. That's why mikechecksmail is about desktop mail clients. I use a Mac, and so it's about Mac desktop mail clients. That said, I won't ignore other systems - good ideas are good ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>email</category><category>filing</category><category>gmail</category><category>inbox-zero</category><category>minimalism</category><category>notification</category><category>philosophy</category><category>quiet</category><category>search</category><guid>http://michael-mccracken.net/2010/03/lets-talk-some-more-email-philosophy-an-email-client-should-help-you-quickly-get-through-new-email/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Mar 2010 16:20:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
