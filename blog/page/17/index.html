  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelmccracken/406122624/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/141/406122624_83b39c417e_t.jpg" alt="Saint IGNUcius at UCSD" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.stallman.org">Richard Stallman</a> gave a talk at the UCSD CS department yesterday, and packed the auditorium despite just one email announcement the afternoon before. There were some people I recognized from SDSC, plenty of students and faculty, and even a bunch of people from the nearby tech companies. His talk was about his philosophy of Free Software, which you can read more about <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/">here</a> - I went to the talk to see him in person, even though I was pretty sure I&#8217;d heard most of what he had to say on the topic already, from his writing on the web and his biography, <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/">&#8220;Free as in Freedom&#8221;</a>, by Sam Williams.</p>

<p>As I expected, there wasn&#8217;t much new (for me) about his main points, but it was interesting to watch him make his argument very carefully,  proceeding logically, as if constructing a proof. He spoke for more than an hour, completely without notes and without pause. It was a great example that if you have a strong point to make and believe in your topic, bullet points are completely unnecessary.</p>

<p>I was a little surprised that he was completely accepting of proprietary software if you never release it - in the Q&A; someone asked him about a situation where their company had internal software that was a competitive advantage, and about his opinion of the ethics of keeping that secret. He said that as long as there were no users of the software who don&#8217;t have the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">four freedoms</a>, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with it. If it only has one user, it&#8217;s free enough if that user never shares it.</p>

<p>He did allow that if there were some custom software that would be very useful and important to society, he might argue it&#8217;d be unethical to not release it, but said that was a separate issue.</p>

<p>His entire crusade is about the freedom of &#8220;your computing&#8221;. I noted that he made a pretty fine distinction about what <em>your</em> computing was. Someone asked him about &#8220;apps running on the web&#8221;. He pounced on that phrasing, describing it as &#8220;a confusion&#8221;, pointing out that the software&#8217;s running on someone&#8217;s server. He then defined the computing that&#8217;s being done when you visit a web site as &#8220;their computing&#8221;, and said it&#8217;s as free as it needs to be, at least as long as it&#8217;s not your data - so, for example, all Google software is free enough by his definition - but he recommends against using GMail because you don&#8217;t have control over your data, and it&#8217;s more your computing at that point (but it&#8217;s a separate issue from the software&#8217;s freedom).</p>

<p>An interesting talk. If you&#8217;re interested in the history of computing, and especially in the ethical issues of software, I&#8217;d suggest reading some of his essays. Even if you don&#8217;t entirely agree with its philosophy, it&#8217;s important to know about the social movement behind the software that runs the web, and most likely runs parts of your personal computing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you only use X11 for XTerm, it might seem like the handling of the clipboard in Apple&#8217;s X11.app is broken. You can select text and paste it with a click of the middle mouse button (opt-click on my Powerbook), and that works when pasting into other X apps, but it doesn&#8217;t change the Mac clipboard at all.</p>

<p>Why not? Is X11.app just ignoring the X clipboard?</p>

<p>No - X11.app <em>does</em> synchronize the two clipboards. The problem is that the selection pasting in XTerm is using a completely different buffer. There&#8217;s a full and clear explanation, with some interesting details about (X)Emacs&#8217; behavior, at <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/x-cut-and-paste.html">jwz.org</a>.</p>

<p>If, like me, you only use X11 for Emacs and XTerm, you might want to link the selection in XTerm to the X clipboard, so X11.app will then sync that with the system clipboard and you can select in XTerm and paste with Cmd-V in say, Mail.app.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll tell you how in a sec, but first the caveat - I said if you only use X11 for Emacs and XTerm because what we&#8217;re going to do is make setting the XTerm selection always overwrite the clipboard contents. If you use X apps that use the X clipboard, sometimes you don&#8217;t want that. So beware. If you use Emacs, it just pushes onto the kill ring, so you&#8217;re good.</p>

<p>OK, now that that&#8217;s over, add these lines to your ~/.Xdefaults:</p>

<pre><code>XTerm*VT100.Translations: #override\
&lt;BtnUp&gt;: select-end(CLIPBOARD,PRIMARY)\n\
&lt;Btn2Down&gt;: insert-selection(PRIMARY)\n\
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the backslashes at the end of the lines are important.</p>

<p>Update: The first version of this post didn&#8217;t include the Btn2Down action. Without that, the original paste behavior goes away - the man page doesn&#8217;t really explain the &#8220;#override&#8221; keyword, so I&#8217;m not sure why.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple days ago, Daniel Jalkut wrote a <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/278/c-is-the-new-assembly">quick note</a> wondering if the future is writing native desktop apps in languages like Python or Ruby, dropping down into C/Obj-C only for performance reasons. It&#8217;s been an interesting thread since then, in comments and other posts.
Notably, today Bill Bumgarner responded with a <a href="http://www.friday.com/bbum/2007/02/16/c-portable-macro-assembler/">long and informative ramble</a> about how the dynamic language future is already here.</p>

<p>Specifically, he notes that the Python-ObjC bridge has been working for quite some time, and is even in use by a few commercial apps.</p>

<p>As official support for this kind of development grows, I bet we&#8217;ll  find more apps written with mostly Python (or Ruby) and a few ObjC/C/C++ bundles or frameworks. I really don&#8217;t think this will be a performance problem - from what I can tell, performance problems in desktop apps are more often algorithm problems or I/O problems - overheads of small constant factors due to using an interpreted language are in the wash.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve probably written as much Python (not using the bridge) as Objective-C, and my experience is that I feel like I&#8217;m solving the problem faster with Python. I particularly like the more compact syntax for common data structures like lists, dictionaries and tuples - I&#8217;ve written and modified a couple of very small Cocoa apps using PyObjC (including Python plugins for VoodooPad), and it feels like I&#8217;m getting away with something when I pass inline lists + dictionaries to AppKit&#8230;</p>

<p>In case you&#8217;re wondering about what Py-Cocoa code looks like, there are a lot of great <a href="http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/examples/index.php">examples</a> on the PyObjC project site. Looking at it now, it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m reading Cocoa email-pseudocode, and I like that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I usually like the link selection I get from the <a href="http://joel.reddit.com/">Joel Reddit</a>, which usually has good software-related essays at the top. It seems to avoid links to uninformed rants about consumer electronics or industry politics, for which I have no use.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like a social links site for software professionals on the Mac - does one exist?</p>

<p>Or am I missing the point of these sites, and there&#8217;s a feature in each of them to get only the links I want?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m curious - how do you get your mac-related links?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> From the comments and some emails, I heard three main ways. A few people just rely on the feeds they check regularly, trusting that if something&#8217;s interesting enough, eventually someone they read will post about it. This was basically my strategy.</p>

<p>A few other people plugged Scott Stevenson&#8217;s <a href="http://cocoablogs.com">Cocoablogs.com</a>, which I remember seeing a while back but overlooked when I wrote this post. He&#8217;s doing a good job of collecting interesting links and highlighting blogs you might want to check out - keep an eye on that site. To paraphrase Scott, he wants cocoablogs to be the &#8216;anti-digg&#8217;, a site where you can guarantee someone actually read the article before they recommend it to you. I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s a good idea - I don&#8217;t have patience for mob voting.</p>

<p>Finally, another suggestion was to follow the <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/cocoa">&#8216;cocoa&#8217; tag on del.icio.us</a>, something else I should have thought of - this is nice and social like digg and reddit, but it seems less likely that someone will tag an article they haven&#8217;t read, so I think it&#8217;s a stronger vote.</p>

<p>Thanks, everyone, for the suggestions!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The other day, I had a big outline on a wiki that I wanted to edit in <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/">OmniOutliner</a> so I could hide and move things around with a real outliner, then export it back out to the wiki.</p>

<p>I managed to get it into OO with copy and paste and a lot of RSI-inducing tabbing, but the text export options can&#8217;t be massaged to export MediaWiki-style (eg, &#8216;#&#8217; for level one, &#8216;##&#8217; for level two).</p>

<p>So I wrote a quick Applescript to get the data out and get me back on my way. I thought I&#8217;d post it in case it would be useful to anyone else:</p>

<pre><code>tell front document of application "OmniOutliner Professional"

    set expText to ""

    repeat with aRow in rows
        set rowText to ""
        -- start from 2 to treat top levels as headers
        repeat with i from 2 to level of aRow
            set rowText to rowText &amp; "#"
        end repeat
        set rowText to rowText &amp; " " &amp; topic of aRow
        set expText to expText &amp; return &amp; rowText
    end repeat

    set the clipboard to expText

    display dialog "The exported text is in the clipboard."
end tell
</code></pre>

<p>Update: see the comments for a version for TWiki. Thanks, Peter!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The excellent <a href="http://takecontrolbooks.com">&#8220;Take Control&#8221;</a> series of Mac ebooks has updated  <a href="http://www.takecontrolbooks.com/backup-macosx.html">&#8220;Take Control of OS X Backups&#8221;</a> to version 2.0.</p>

<p>I have gotten a lot of use out of their other books. <a href="http://www.takecontrolbooks.com/AirPort.html">&#8220;Take Control of Your Airport Network&#8221;</a> saved me a lot of frustration setting up a network for my roommates, and <a href="http://www.takecontrolbooks.com/spam-apple-mail.html">&#8220;Take Control of Spam with Apple Mail&#8221;</a> is what led me to buy  <a href="http://c-command.com/spamsieve/">SpamSieve</a>, so the book deserves part of the credit for solving my spam problem.</p>

<p>So, when I saw that they had a book about backups, I jumped at the chance to get some more good practical advice. Since I already have a copy of Retrospect sitting around gathering dust, I was happy to see a great section dedicated to setting up a recommended backup plan using Retrospect. That section was helpful enough to get me back on track with regular full duplicate backups as well as the incremental backups of selected files I was already doing. That alone was well worth the cost of the book.</p>
