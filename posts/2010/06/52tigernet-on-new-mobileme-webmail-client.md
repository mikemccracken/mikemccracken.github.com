		A nice detailed description of the updates to MobileMe's webmail client from Dave Caolo at his new blog, [52tiger](http://52tiger.net/).

I haven't used MobileMe mail for several years, mostly because the couple hundred dollars I spent on .Mac without ever really getting much use out of it, before finally canceling it far too late, still kind of stings.
