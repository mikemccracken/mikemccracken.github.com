I read John Siracusa's "Copland 2010" article back in '05, and listened to his recent update of it on his podcast. I wasn't very convinced, but I couldn't figure out quite how to say why. Today I think Guy nailed it:



> Siracusa argues that abstraction is the all consuming beast of computer science, I think he’s mostly correct but I can’t help but feel he’s more worried about abstracting yesterday’s issues than tomorrow’s.
