  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you spend a lot of time reading articles and research papers that you get in PDF form, then you might be interested in the latest app from the folks who brought you <a href="http://bibdesk.sf.net">BibDesk</a>. If you already use BibDesk, then you certainly want to take a look.</p>

<p>Even though we keep our research papers stored on disk as PDF, all too often we print them out to read and write notes on. There&#8217;s something missing in the experience of reading papers on a computer, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be that way.</p>

<p><img src="http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/images/skimIcon.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Announcing <a href="http://skim-app.sf.net">Skim</a>. Skim is a PDF reading and note-taking app for Mac OS X that is designed to make reading research papers and manuals better. Just like in Preview, you can search, scan, and zoom through PDFs, but you also get some custom features for your workflow:</p>

<ul>
<li>Snapshots: if there&#8217;s a graph on page two and the description continues to page three, just draw a box around the graph with the command key down and a snapshot window pops up with the graph, and you can keep on reading with the graph in view. For more fun, minimize that snapshot window - they stick around in their own dock in the document window.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="http://michael-mccracken.net/2007/skimSnapshot.png" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Tooltips: If a PDF has links, such as for citation references or indexes and section headings, you can click on them as usual to go to the destination, but there&#8217;s more - hover the mouse over those links and Skim will show you a tooltip with the target of the link. No more losing your place to peek at a citation! For more fun, command-click on a link to pop up a snapshot window showing the link&#8217;s destination.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="http://michael-mccracken.net/2007/skimTooltip.png" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Presentation and Full-screen Modes: Full-screen reading is handy. So is showing a PDF as a presentation. But they&#8217;re a little different. For instance, you might not want to show the table of contents in a presentation, but it&#8217;s nice to see it when you&#8217;re just reading by yourself. So Full-screen and Presentation are separate modes in Skim.</li>
</ul>


<p>There&#8217;s plenty more - <a href="http://skim-app.sf.net">download it</a> and take a look, and join the <a href="http://skim-app.sf.net/mailingLists.html">mailing list</a> to discuss it. There&#8217;s even a full help book in the first public beta release!</p>

<p>Many thanks to everyone who has worked on this app, and especially to Christiaan Hofman, who moved the app from a prototype to something really useful faster than I would have thought possible.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last year I wrote about my <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/wp/?p=39">new page template for VoodooPad</a>. I still use something like it - I like the uniform look and the built-in navigation starters I get in every page.</p>

<p>I got tired of all the clicking around it took to fill in the navigation every time I put in a new page, so I decided to write a script to mimic XCode&#8217;s &#8220;Select Next Placeholder&#8221; command. In XCode, if you use code completion, you might get something like this:
<code>[dict setObject:&lt;# (id) anObject #&gt; forKey:&lt;# (id)key #&gt;]</code> Then pressing Control-/ cycles the selection through those placeholders so you can replace them with whatever you want quickly.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s really handy for code, and it&#8217;s great for VoodooPad templates too. I wrote the script as a Python script plugin for VoodooPad, and it maps Command-/ to select the next placeholder, wrapping the search at the end just like XCode does. Now my new page template in VoodooPad has a few placeholders in it, and I have a lot fewer pages with default template text sitting in there making me look lazy.</p>

<p>Download it <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/2007/Select-Next-Placeholder.py">here</a>. (Note, it needs the <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/fs/flystashweb.cgi/40de692c-e33c-01d9-12a1-c0cbe4c4d9e7">VoodooPad Python Plugin Enabler</a> )</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelmccracken/406122624/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/141/406122624_83b39c417e_t.jpg" alt="Saint IGNUcius at UCSD" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.stallman.org">Richard Stallman</a> gave a talk at the UCSD CS department yesterday, and packed the auditorium despite just one email announcement the afternoon before. There were some people I recognized from SDSC, plenty of students and faculty, and even a bunch of people from the nearby tech companies. His talk was about his philosophy of Free Software, which you can read more about <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/">here</a> - I went to the talk to see him in person, even though I was pretty sure I&#8217;d heard most of what he had to say on the topic already, from his writing on the web and his biography, <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/">&#8220;Free as in Freedom&#8221;</a>, by Sam Williams.</p>

<p>As I expected, there wasn&#8217;t much new (for me) about his main points, but it was interesting to watch him make his argument very carefully,  proceeding logically, as if constructing a proof. He spoke for more than an hour, completely without notes and without pause. It was a great example that if you have a strong point to make and believe in your topic, bullet points are completely unnecessary.</p>

<p>I was a little surprised that he was completely accepting of proprietary software if you never release it - in the Q&A; someone asked him about a situation where their company had internal software that was a competitive advantage, and about his opinion of the ethics of keeping that secret. He said that as long as there were no users of the software who don&#8217;t have the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">four freedoms</a>, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with it. If it only has one user, it&#8217;s free enough if that user never shares it.</p>

<p>He did allow that if there were some custom software that would be very useful and important to society, he might argue it&#8217;d be unethical to not release it, but said that was a separate issue.</p>

<p>His entire crusade is about the freedom of &#8220;your computing&#8221;. I noted that he made a pretty fine distinction about what <em>your</em> computing was. Someone asked him about &#8220;apps running on the web&#8221;. He pounced on that phrasing, describing it as &#8220;a confusion&#8221;, pointing out that the software&#8217;s running on someone&#8217;s server. He then defined the computing that&#8217;s being done when you visit a web site as &#8220;their computing&#8221;, and said it&#8217;s as free as it needs to be, at least as long as it&#8217;s not your data - so, for example, all Google software is free enough by his definition - but he recommends against using GMail because you don&#8217;t have control over your data, and it&#8217;s more your computing at that point (but it&#8217;s a separate issue from the software&#8217;s freedom).</p>

<p>An interesting talk. If you&#8217;re interested in the history of computing, and especially in the ethical issues of software, I&#8217;d suggest reading some of his essays. Even if you don&#8217;t entirely agree with its philosophy, it&#8217;s important to know about the social movement behind the software that runs the web, and most likely runs parts of your personal computing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you only use X11 for XTerm, it might seem like the handling of the clipboard in Apple&#8217;s X11.app is broken. You can select text and paste it with a click of the middle mouse button (opt-click on my Powerbook), and that works when pasting into other X apps, but it doesn&#8217;t change the Mac clipboard at all.</p>

<p>Why not? Is X11.app just ignoring the X clipboard?</p>

<p>No - X11.app <em>does</em> synchronize the two clipboards. The problem is that the selection pasting in XTerm is using a completely different buffer. There&#8217;s a full and clear explanation, with some interesting details about (X)Emacs&#8217; behavior, at <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/x-cut-and-paste.html">jwz.org</a>.</p>

<p>If, like me, you only use X11 for Emacs and XTerm, you might want to link the selection in XTerm to the X clipboard, so X11.app will then sync that with the system clipboard and you can select in XTerm and paste with Cmd-V in say, Mail.app.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll tell you how in a sec, but first the caveat - I said if you only use X11 for Emacs and XTerm because what we&#8217;re going to do is make setting the XTerm selection always overwrite the clipboard contents. If you use X apps that use the X clipboard, sometimes you don&#8217;t want that. So beware. If you use Emacs, it just pushes onto the kill ring, so you&#8217;re good.</p>

<p>OK, now that that&#8217;s over, add these lines to your ~/.Xdefaults:</p>

<pre><code>XTerm*VT100.Translations: #override\
&lt;BtnUp&gt;: select-end(CLIPBOARD,PRIMARY)\n\
&lt;Btn2Down&gt;: insert-selection(PRIMARY)\n\
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the backslashes at the end of the lines are important.</p>

<p>Update: The first version of this post didn&#8217;t include the Btn2Down action. Without that, the original paste behavior goes away - the man page doesn&#8217;t really explain the &#8220;#override&#8221; keyword, so I&#8217;m not sure why.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple days ago, Daniel Jalkut wrote a <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/278/c-is-the-new-assembly">quick note</a> wondering if the future is writing native desktop apps in languages like Python or Ruby, dropping down into C/Obj-C only for performance reasons. It&#8217;s been an interesting thread since then, in comments and other posts.
Notably, today Bill Bumgarner responded with a <a href="http://www.friday.com/bbum/2007/02/16/c-portable-macro-assembler/">long and informative ramble</a> about how the dynamic language future is already here.</p>

<p>Specifically, he notes that the Python-ObjC bridge has been working for quite some time, and is even in use by a few commercial apps.</p>

<p>As official support for this kind of development grows, I bet we&#8217;ll  find more apps written with mostly Python (or Ruby) and a few ObjC/C/C++ bundles or frameworks. I really don&#8217;t think this will be a performance problem - from what I can tell, performance problems in desktop apps are more often algorithm problems or I/O problems - overheads of small constant factors due to using an interpreted language are in the wash.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve probably written as much Python (not using the bridge) as Objective-C, and my experience is that I feel like I&#8217;m solving the problem faster with Python. I particularly like the more compact syntax for common data structures like lists, dictionaries and tuples - I&#8217;ve written and modified a couple of very small Cocoa apps using PyObjC (including Python plugins for VoodooPad), and it feels like I&#8217;m getting away with something when I pass inline lists + dictionaries to AppKit&#8230;</p>

<p>In case you&#8217;re wondering about what Py-Cocoa code looks like, there are a lot of great <a href="http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/examples/index.php">examples</a> on the PyObjC project site. Looking at it now, it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m reading Cocoa email-pseudocode, and I like that.</p>
