[lolstartups, While at the GTUG Campout in Mountain View, Jacob...](http://lolstartups.com/post/159322545/while-at-the-gtug-campout-in-mountain-view-jacob).

This shows an example of an app built on top of google wave that has nothing to do with email and is really impressive and useful.

If I had to guess, wave will be a successful platform for lots of applications that don't look much like email at all. And we'll still have email as it exists today.
