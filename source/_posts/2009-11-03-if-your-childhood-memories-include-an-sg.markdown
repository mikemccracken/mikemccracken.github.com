If your childhood memories include an SGI Indy set up underneath the coat rack downstairs, maybe you'll get the same time-traveling wonder out of the Electropaint Screensaver. I found a Universal Build of [ElectropaintOSX](http://vonbelow.com/weblog/archives/38-Electropaint-Universal.html) at vonBelow.com, and it's just how I remembered. There's a picture there, but you have to see it in motion. It's like a deck of cards circling a bug-zapper. It's beautiful.
