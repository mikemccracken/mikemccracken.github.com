My shared links for March 18th through March 26th:






  * [7 Years of YouTube Scalability Lessons in 30 Minutes](http://highscalability.com/blog/2012/3/26/7-years-of-youtube-scalability-lessons-in-30-minutes.html) - Notes from a PyCon talk about the very pragmatic design philosophy at YouTube.


  * [bkad/discoball * GitHub](https://github.com/bkad/discoball) - shell tool to match and colorize lines of text


  * [The Pragmatic Bookshelf | The Developer's Code](http://pragprog.com/book/kcdc/the-developer-s-code) - 


  * [How to see around corners : Nature News & Comment](http://www.nature.com/news/how-to-see-around-corners-1.10258) - And we thought the future was flying cars.


  * [ARM's ultra-low-power fridge-puter chips: Just what the CIA ordered â€¢ The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/03/19/cia_internet_of_things/page2.html) - Out of context interesting quote: "The spy boss was chiefly concerned with the huge amounts of data that can be collected from American citizens who intend to become CIA agents - in an age when parents set up Twitter and Tumblr accounts for their newborns, managing the identities of future operatives suddenly becomes non-trivial."


  * [Who needs access? You need access!](http://reprog.wordpress.com/2012/02/27/who-needs-access-you-need-access/) - new site about open access to research aimed at lay people (I think)
