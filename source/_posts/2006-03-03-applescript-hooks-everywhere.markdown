A quick thought: why not wrap NSUndoManager to support adding scriptable hooks to almost any user action? Surely someone can think of a good scheme to let an application programmer support really thorough scriptability without tons of extra work...

I thought of this because I'd like a way to mark a To-do item for an email reply as completed once I'd sent the email, and a good way would be with an email-send hook in Apple Mail.

Okay that's it, thanks!
