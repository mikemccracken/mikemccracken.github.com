Just noticed this: [Two-Way Data Binding in Flex 4](http://www.artima.com/articles/two_way_binding.html).

Flex is an SDK for building Flash apps that I know nothing about, but this article presents whatÂ looks like a rough equivalent of Cocoa Bindings, and it has one really nice property that Cocoa has always been missing - say what you want about specifying a UI with XML, but the Flex XML looked like it'd be relatively easy to scan, search and diff. I've always thought that a human-readable text format for Cocoa NIBs would be a big improvement.
