My shared links for December 22nd:






  * [Pearsonified's Golden Ratio Typography Calculator](http://www.pearsonified.com/typography/) - calculates line height, font size and content width appropriately for readability. Using the golden ratio might be bogus, but the point of matching font size to line width and height is well taken and the results look OK.
