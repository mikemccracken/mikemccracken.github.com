My shared links for March 30th through April 3rd:






  * [Magic Maps: Now You See It.](http://magicmaps.evanmiller.org/) - Very cool app for working with maps and time series data


  * [How Not To Sort By Average Rating](http://evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html) - Shows the best way to sort by positive/negative rankings that is robust to small sample sizes


  * [terrorism hardly existential threat. 2010](http://m.foreignaffairs.com/articles/66186/john-mueller-and-mark-g-stewart/hardly-existential) - 


  * [workhacks.com: Top 3 Gmail Management Apps for Mac](http://mailplaneapp.com/blog/entry/workhacks.com_top_3_gmail_management_apps_for_mac/#When:12:06:06Z) includes a list of gmail plugins that look useful 


  * [Yesod Web Framework for Haskell](http://www.yesodweb.com/) - 


  * [beets: the music geek's media organizer](http://beets.radbox.org/) - The purpose of beets is to get your music collection right once and for all. It catalogs your collection, automatically improving its metadata as it goes using the MusicBrainz database. (It also downloads cover art for albums it imports.) Then it provides a bouquet of tools for manipulating and accessing your music.

Because beets is designed as a library, it can do almost anything you can imagine for your music collection. Via plugins, beets becomes a panacea:

Embed and extract album art from files' tags.
Listen to your library with a music player that speaks the MPD protocol and works with a staggering variety of interfaces.
Fetch lyrics for all your songs from databases on the Web.
Manage your MusicBrainz music collection.
Analyze music files' metadata from the command line.
Clean up crufty tags left behind by other, less-awesome tools.
Browse your music library graphically through a Web browser and play it in any browser that supports HTML5 Audio.
