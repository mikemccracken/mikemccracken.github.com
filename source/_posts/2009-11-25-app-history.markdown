I just saw Brent's post from a couple weeks ago about an [App History App](http://inessential.com/2009/11/08/apphistory_app_idea) - I think that'd be really cool. I especially like the screen shot idea, since I love seeing posts from a developer showing what an app looked like along the progression. It's too easy to forget to document that kind of thing, and I'd love it if we saw more of these behind-the-scenes posts.
