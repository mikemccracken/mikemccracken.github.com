<p>So all these years later I'm trying to make a very odd movie indeed, about computer chess programmers circa 1980, and perhaps deep down it's my attempt to vicariously peek into the fantasy braniac life I ought to have pursued as a kid. It happens to be a fascinating era for the field. As computers were exploding into the public sphere, and regular folks were just getting used to seeing them in the workplace, or home, a group of geniuses at the vanguard of the technology were trying to teach it what seemed like an almost unimaginable skill--could these machines, these glorified calculators, ever conquer the human world champion in chess? Obviously a human being would have to be a genius to be the world chess champ, so if they could get a computer to do it, the computer would have to acquire a kind of genius, right?</p>

<p>Here are some features I want but I'll never have time to write the scripts for VoodooPad to do.</p>
<p>I use VP mostly as a running log of notes, shell commands and todos. I also use OmniFocus for task tracking, but sometimes it's easier to just start typing in VP and work out the tasks later. So I often end up with VP pages that have a bunch of todos mixed in with project headers and miscellaneous notes.</p>
<p>I've been thinking some integration would be nice. I want an <del><a href="http://orgmode.org/">emacs org-mode</a></del> (update: I meant <a href="http://www.isi.edu/~johnh/SOFTWARE/NOTES_MODE/">notes-mode</a>) style "new day" script that creates a new page for the day and does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>adds a link to the new page to the previous note page</li>
<li>moves any pending todos (I mark them as lines starting with a &lt;# todo #&gt; placeholder so I can jump to them) off yesterday's page and into OmniFocus </li>
<li>starts a new header (line starting with #, in bold) in the new page for every header that had leftover todos. These headers usually correspond to projects in OmniFocus.</li>
<li>adds new headers and todo lines for any tasks that are due today</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to have VP autocomplete project names from OmniFocus when I start a header line. Then add a link next to the new header pointing to the last page containing that header. </p>
<p>I'd also like to have OmniFocus update the VP document when I check off a task in OF - I want to use VP as a log, so I can track down when I did something. Maybe projects should all have their own VP pages, that are kind of an auto-updated index of progress on the tasks.</p>
<p>It'd also be nice if when I edited a todo line in VP, it could update OF. I guess I want VP to be an supplemental synchronized view onto my OF tasks.</p>
<p>For the Terminal: I do a lot of copying and pasting shell commands into VP so I can remember things like important paths, or the exact configure settings I used to build something two years ago. This is really useful, but it'd be nice if it was easier to do without leaving the terminal. Ideally I could just prefix a command with something like '@' to add it to the current page in VP (or '@pagename#headername' to get fancy). You could get this with a script named '@' - on your local machine. But it also has to work when you're working remotely, so it will get a little more complicated.</p>
<p>Finally - this is something I wanted to try doing with an InputManager before that mechanism went away: I'd like CamelCase links in every text field on the system (probably with some exceptions) to automatically link to VP pages. But it sounds like the days of modifying system-wide behavior on Macs are history, so I'll probably never get this. Who knows, maybe it would've been a disaster. </p>
<p>I always thought the path to improvement in work computing was more and deeper integration between 3rd-party apps, as well as more system functionality that's usable by all those apps, but it looks to me* like in OS X we're only getting the latter.</p>

<p>One nit - I don't think it's obvious what happens to the red position bar (what to call that?) when you just press the arrows on the thumb instead of moving it around.</p>
