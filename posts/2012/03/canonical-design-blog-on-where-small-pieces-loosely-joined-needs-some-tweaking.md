[Holistic UI is smarter UX](http://design.canonical.com/2012/03/holistic-ui-is-smarter-ux/) - They use notifications as an example of why small pieces loosely joined might not be great UI. It's really interesting to see how common UI devices such as notifications have evolved across various platforms. Someone should do a gallery of notifications over the years - bonus points if you start with a ‚êá!
