Hey, the O'Reilly [Emerging Technology conference](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/et2006/) is in San Diego next week. I live in San Diego - but I can't even afford the deeply discounted student admissions. I'd go to see the [microformats session](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2006/view/e_sess/8292), since I'm interested in seeing a good [citation microformat](http://microformats.org/wiki/citation) develop.

If anyone I know or should know is in town for the conference and wants to hang out, I know a few good places to go - [email me](mailto:michael_mccracken@mac.com) or something.
