&lt;p&gt;These posts about blogging are really only interesting years later,
and only to me, when I look back and think about what I was doing that
I thought I had time to mess with blogging software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/blog/2005/12/25/test-wordpress/"&gt;Last time&lt;/a&gt; I made a major change was switching to wordpress from
blosxom back in December 2005, over Christmas break. I was at my
parents' house and had nothing to do after everyone went to bed at 9pm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days I can't remember the feeling of having nothing to do, but I
went ahead and switched things up anyway, exactly because I don't have
time to mess with things like upgrading wordpress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'm going with octopress on github user pages. I like generating a
static site from text files, and github pages are sort of convenient. (sort of)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>meta blogging</category><guid>http://michael-mccracken.net/2012/08/no-more-wordpress/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 15 Aug 2012 15:21:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
