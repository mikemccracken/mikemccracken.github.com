This is really cool: Fran Allen, a founder of the field of program optimization and compiler analysis, will be the first woman to receive the Turing Award. More info, including a description of her accomplishments, is at the [ACM press release](http://campus.acm.org/public/pressroom/press_releases/2_2007/turing2006.cfm).
