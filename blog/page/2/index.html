  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometime in January, a <a href="http://skim-app.sourceforge.net">Skim</a> user asked the developers if we&#8217;d submitted it to the Mac App Store. We hadn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>The app listed for sale for $29 on the store as &#8220;PDF Reader&#8221; is actually our free and open source Skim app, although no mention of the Skim Sourceforge project is made in the description, and the support link just goes to a livejournal post where the Skim web page ad copy has been pasted. There is also a $19 app called &#8220;PDF Expert&#8221; that appears to be another copy. That one even went ahead and used Adobe&#8217;s Acrobat trademark in their icon!</p>

<p>Anyone who buys these apps is paying for a program that has no support from and no coordination with the actual developers and an unknown update or bug fix schedule. They won&#8217;t know about the tips and support available on the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/skim-app/index.php?title=Main_Page">Skim wiki</a> or the users mailing list.
They could get a better product for free.</p>

<p>Naturally, I&#8217;d like to see these unofficial copies removed from the store.</p>

<p>Because the project uses the permissive BSD license, it&#8217;s officially OK to take the code, change nothing, and sell it. However, there is an acknowledgement clause, so if a copy doesn&#8217;t mention the actual authors anywhere, it&#8217;s in violation of the license.</p>

<p>At one point in mid-January, &#8220;PDF Reader&#8221; was offered for free, so the main developer, Christiaan Hofman, downloaded it to check. He found no mention of the original authors. So now we have something we can actually complain about.</p>

<p>Now, I wrote an initial prototype and started the sourceforge project, but Christiaan deserves most of the credit for the great app that it became. However, mostly because of my role at the beginning, I am the copyright holder of the overall product and many of the source files. So I took the lead, and over the past few weeks I&#8217;ve been trying to figure out who to talk to in Apple to even find out what my options are.</p>

<p>I emailed Mac App Store support, who pointed me to both the Developer Relations contact info and to Apple Legal. Developer Relations said they can&#8217;t help me because I&#8217;m not a member the Apple Developer Program, so they also pointed to Legal. Ok, a bit of runaround, but I thought contacting Legal seemed reasonable.</p>

<p>Funny, I never thought I&#8217;d want to send a DMCA takedown notice, but this <em>is</em> a copyright claim. I decided to use their copyright violation reporting form. In Safari and every other browser I tried, this form just doesn&#8217;t work! It keeps asking for my phone number even when it already has it&#8230; So on January 26 I sent a request to copyright@apple.com with the info for the form and asked what to do next.</p>

<p>Since then I&#8217;ve heard nothing, so I thought it might be time to ask the rest of the world - has anyone had to deal with violations like this before, and is there a better way to address it?</p>

What you want to do is create new programming languages, combining new and old ideas into a fresh whole. It sounds like a fun, intellectually demanding job, and occasionally it is. However, we know from experience that languages that exist solely in the mind or on paper are mostly worthless: it is only when they are implemented and we can try them out that we can evaluate them. As well as a language design, therefore, we need a corresponding language implementation.&#8221;</p></li>

In addition, I&#8217;ll show you how you can easily share your translations across multiple apps and platforms.

<p>Conduit manages the synchronization and conversion of data into other formats. For example, Conduit allows you to :</p>

<p>Synchronize your Tomboy notes with another computer
Synchronize your your PIM data to your mobile phone, iPod, Nokia Internet tablet, or between computers
Upload photos to Flickr, Picasa, SmugMug, ShutterFly and your iPod
Any combination you can imagine, Conduit will take care of the conversion and synchronization.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://design.canonical.com/2012/01/introducing-the-hud-say-hello-to-the-future-of-the-menu/">Introducing the HUD. Say hello to the future of the menu. « Canonical Design</a> - Canonical is moving towards no menus and just using a quicksilver-style &#8220;HUD&#8221; smart text interface. That&#8217;s great - menus stink and this gives a path to voice control too, but there&#8217;s a big discovery problem to be attacked (which menus also have but not as bad).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://voices.canonical.com/ubuntuone/?p=1342">Ubuntu One Blog » Blog Archive » U1DB technical preview release: tell us what you think!</a> - Blog post announcing u1db preview</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://people.canonical.com/~aquarius/u1db-docs/">U1DB &#8211; u1db v0.0.1.dev.0 documentation</a> - Developer preview documentation. Their summary:
&#8221;
U1DB is a database API for synchronised databases of JSON documents. It&#8217;s simple to use in applications, and allows apps to store documents and synchronise them between machines and devices. U1DB itself is not a database: instead, it&#8217;s an API which can be backed by any database for storage. This means that you can use u1db on different platforms, from different languages, and backed on to different databases, and sync between all of them.
