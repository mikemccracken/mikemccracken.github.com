A nice writeup of using BibDesk with Subversion:

[BibDesk, BibTeX and Subversion - An academic's necessity](http://weblog.terrellrussell.com/2007/02/bibdesk-bibtex-and-subversion-an-academics-necessity/):



> I decided I'd choose based on 1) open formats, 2) documentation, and an 3) open development model (open source). After looking through RefWorks, vanilla BibTeX files, ProCite, EndNote, Reference Manager (the application) and BibDesk, I chose BibDesk.
