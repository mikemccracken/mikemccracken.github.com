From the National Academies: 

[The Future of Computing Performance: Game Over or Next Level?](http://nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12980).



A nice, thorough explanation of the current challenges in computing performance, ranging from transistor-level power vs. speed problems, up to how to program the circuits we're likely to end up with.

Also includes a bonus reprint of two classic papers, Gordon Moore's "Cramming More Components onto Integrated Circuits" from 1965 - that's the paper you might expect it is, and Robert Dennard's "Design of Ion-Implanted MOSFETâ€™s with Very Small Physical Dimensions", which I was less familiar with.
