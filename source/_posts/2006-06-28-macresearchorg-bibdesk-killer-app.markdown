Over at [macresearch.org](http://macresearch.org/), they've posted a nice [review of BibDesk][1]. One quote: "If you use Latex search no more, this is a killer app." Kudos to Adam and Christiaan.

I see an increasing number of Macs at research meetings I go to, and I usually can't help but peek on their dock to look for that yellow folder. I usually don't ask people if they've heard of it, but I have thought of putting a big sticker with the BibDesk icon on my PowerBook, just to see if anyone recognizes it.
