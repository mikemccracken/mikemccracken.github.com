[![Buzz and the TLR](http://static.flickr.com/54/182960262_c764eb8881_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelmccracken/182960262/) 

[Buzz Andersen](http://weblog.scifihifi.com/) was in town for the 4th of July, and we both took a few photos, up on Flickr: [Buzz's San Diego Photos](http://flickr.com/photos/ldandersen/tags/sandiego/), and [my photos of Buzz](http://flickr.com/photos/michaelmccracken/tags/buzz/).

When I get the film back from the [Yashica](http://flickr.com/photos/michaelmccracken/tags/yashica/), I'll scan some more photos in.

In the meantime, I've been getting more into photography, so if you want the full MMC web experience, you could subscribe to a [feed of my photos](http://flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?id=51035756035@N01&format;=rss_200), which should already be part of my [feedburner feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/Michael-mccrackennet). And if you're a fellow Flickr photo nut, feel free to add me as a contact and tell me when I reach  photo genius.

PS, I've been working with the [Adobe Lightroom beta](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/lightroom/) to process my pictures lately. I really like the focus on workflow, and the UI is very responsive on my old PowerBook G4. It does get a little slower when dealing with 6MP RAW photos, but almost never beachballs. Furthermore, single key shortcuts are priceless for a program aimed at serious users.
