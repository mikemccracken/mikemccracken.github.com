On the way back, I stopped at the end of Felspar street and took some shots of the beach scene. My favorite two are already up at Flickr, but I thought I'd expand on them a bit here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the end of Crystal Pier, which houses a hotel (you can see the last of the cabins on the left). I took a bunch of these shots, playing with the sensitivity and exposure. This was the longest - at ISO 200 and f/4.0, exposed for about 10 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with an f/1.4 lens, it was super dark and I had to focus manually. I set the camera on a post and used a 2-second delayed shutter to keep it still and out of my shaky hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelmccracken/186275976/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Crystal Pier" src="http://static.flickr.com/65/186275976_91ad85b289.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, here's a version taken at ISO 1600 :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even reduced in size, you can really notice the noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a shot of a cleaning lady working at JRDN, the swank bar in the new Tower 23 hotel. Tower 23 doesn't really fit in in PB - it's way too self-conscious and preening of a place to feel natural in such a laid-back, seedy beach neighborhood. It seemed appropriate that on a Sunday night when the more relaxed established places like the PB Bar &amp;amp; Grill and Longboards were really hopping, JRDN was closed - looking its ghostly best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should have remembered that I'd set the 2-second delay before I took this shot - I had the woman framed well, hit the shutter and wondered what was going on. Luckily, she stayed in the door frame, but I could swear it was a better shot just two seconds before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelmccracken/186275981/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bar cleanup" src="http://static.flickr.com/17/186275981_97a6aa094c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's another missed shot opportunity, as she ducks behind the bar just as I find the right exposure and focus. I think the color in the other one makes it better, but the angle of the bar on this one has some promise. Shot through a couple of layers of glass, and manual focus - I'm sure it could be sharper if I'd kept trying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://weblog.scifihifi.com/"&gt;Buzz Andersen&lt;/a&gt; was in town for the 4th of July, and we both took a few photos, up on Flickr: &lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/ldandersen/tags/sandiego/"&gt;Buzz's San Diego Photos&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/michaelmccracken/tags/buzz/"&gt;my photos of Buzz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I get the film back from the &lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/michaelmccracken/tags/yashica/"&gt;Yashica&lt;/a&gt;, I'll scan some more photos in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I've been getting more into photography, so if you want the full MMC web experience, you could subscribe to a &lt;a href="http://flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?id=51035756035@N01&amp;amp;format;=rss_200"&gt;feed of my photos&lt;/a&gt;, which should already be part of my &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Michael-mccrackennet"&gt;feedburner feed&lt;/a&gt;. And if you're a fellow Flickr photo nut, feel free to add me as a contact and tell me when I reach  photo genius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS, I've been working with the &lt;a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/lightroom/"&gt;Adobe Lightroom beta&lt;/a&gt; to process my pictures lately. I really like the focus on workflow, and the UI is very responsive on my old PowerBook G4. It does get a little slower when dealing with 6MP RAW photos, but almost never beachballs. Furthermore, single key shortcuts are priceless for a program aimed at serious users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>digital camera</category><category>mac</category><category>photo</category><category>photography</category><guid>http://michael-mccracken.net/2006/07/photos-buzz-4th/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jul 2006 10:20:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
