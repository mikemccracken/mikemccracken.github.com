About a year ago, I [decided](http://michael-mccracken.net/2010/04/i-have-a-minor-obsession-with-email-clie/) to start a separate blog called 'mikechecksmail' on Tumblr to talk about the details of mail clients on OS X. 

I posted a few real articles there, then let things sit for a while as a dissertation, a new house, and a new baby have taken up my free time.

I've now decided to keep occasionally writing about email, just here at my good old personal blog. So I've imported the old posts from Tumblr, and anything new will be here. Hopefully having just one place for things will make it easier to actually write anything at all.
