  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here are some features I want but I&rsquo;ll never have time to write the scripts for VoodooPad to do.</p>

<p>I use VP mostly as a running log of notes, shell commands and todos. I also use OmniFocus for task tracking, but sometimes it&rsquo;s easier to just start typing in VP and work out the tasks later. So I often end up with VP pages that have a bunch of todos mixed in with project headers and miscellaneous notes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking some integration would be nice. I want an <del><a href="http://orgmode.org/">emacs org-mode</a></del> (update: I meant <a href="http://www.isi.edu/~johnh/SOFTWARE/NOTES_MODE/">notes-mode</a>) style &ldquo;new day&rdquo; script that creates a new page for the day and does the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>adds a link to the new page to the previous note page</li>
<li>moves any pending todos (I mark them as lines starting with a &lt;# todo #> placeholder so I can jump to them) off yesterday&rsquo;s page and into OmniFocus</li>
<li>starts a new header (line starting with #, in bold) in the new page for every header that had leftover todos. These headers usually correspond to projects in OmniFocus.</li>
<li>adds new headers and todo lines for any tasks that are due today</li>
</ul>


<p>I want to have VP autocomplete project names from OmniFocus when I start a header line. Then add a link next to the new header pointing to the last page containing that header.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d also like to have OmniFocus update the VP document when I check off a task in OF &ndash; I want to use VP as a log, so I can track down when I did something. Maybe projects should all have their own VP pages, that are kind of an auto-updated index of progress on the tasks.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;d also be nice if when I edited a todo line in VP, it could update OF. I guess I want VP to be an supplemental synchronized view onto my OF tasks.</p>

<p>For the Terminal: I do a lot of copying and pasting shell commands into VP so I can remember things like important paths, or the exact configure settings I used to build something two years ago. This is really useful, but it&rsquo;d be nice if it was easier to do without leaving the terminal. Ideally I could just prefix a command with something like &lsquo;@&rsquo; to add it to the current page in VP (or &lsquo;@pagename#headername&rsquo; to get fancy). You could get this with a script named &lsquo;@&rsquo; &ndash; on your local machine. But it also has to work when you&rsquo;re working remotely, so it will get a little more complicated.</p>

<p>Finally &ndash; this is something I wanted to try doing with an InputManager before that mechanism went away: I&rsquo;d like CamelCase links in every text field on the system (probably with some exceptions) to automatically link to VP pages. But it sounds like the days of modifying system-wide behavior on Macs are history, so I&rsquo;ll probably never get this. Who knows, maybe it would&rsquo;ve been a disaster.</p>

<p>I always thought the path to improvement in work computing was more and deeper integration between 3rd-party apps, as well as more system functionality that&rsquo;s usable by all those apps, but it looks to me* like in OS X we&rsquo;re only getting the latter.</p>

<p><em>* &ndash; since 10.7 is about to come out, it might be worth pointing out that I have no special advance developer info. I haven&rsquo;t even been a dev program member for a few years now.</em></p>
