I couldn't make it to WWDC last year, I'm not at Macworld this week, but I will be making it up to LA on the 19th for the [Leopard Tech Talk](http://developer.apple.com/events/techtalks/northamerica.html), to catch up. I'll probably be there the day before, owing to traffic and an inability to wake up early.

If any area mac devs are meeting up around then, drop me a note.

I wonder if we'll know anything by then about developing for the iPhone.
