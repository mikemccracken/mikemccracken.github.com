&lt;a href="http://design.canonical.com/2011/03/introducing-overlay-scrollbars-in-unity/"&gt;Introducing Overlay Scrollbars in Unity&lt;/a&gt;. (Who wouldn't love to see an Apple Design blog? It's fun to follow along as some serious, talented people rethink stuff we use everyday…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the video - and stick with it all the way through. At first I didn't like it but now I'm a fan. I like that they've expanded usable screen real estate by getting rid of the everpresent thumb, but kept a subtle visual indicator that there's more content - there's a small ~2px bar that scales like current thumbs do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only concern would be that the little mini-thumb is too small and it will sometimes not be obvious that you can scroll. I think this happens on iOS, too - maybe it's not such a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>computers</category><category>interfaces</category><guid>http://michael-mccracken.net/2011/03/overlay-scrollbars-canonical-design/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 Mar 2011 20:16:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
