Some great samples and historical tidbits from Fresh Air: [Before Ipanema: Stan Getz's exquisite quintets](http://www.npr.org/2011/03/18/134652613/before-ipanema-stan-getzs-exquisite-quintets?ft=1&f;=13&sc;=17)



> Before he was famous for popularizing bossa nova with "The Girl from Ipanema" in the early 1960s, saxophonist Stan Getz recorded with small jazz groups all through the '50s. Jazz critic Kevin Whitehead says a new reissue shows Getz was one of the best at playing pretty.




I really love Fresh Air. I used to listen to it every day after school while playing Crystal Quest in my room. Every time I hear Terry Gross' voice, I get a bit of a rush like I'm goofing off instead of doing my homework.
