Link: [Adam Engst on GMail at Tidbits](http://tidbits.com/article/12036)

The start of a 3-part series on GMail from Adam Engst. He was a long-time Eudora user, so it's interesting to see how his workflow changed when he moved to such a different program.

Also, as a journalist I'm sure he gets *tons* more email than average people, and he can't afford to just ignore it.
