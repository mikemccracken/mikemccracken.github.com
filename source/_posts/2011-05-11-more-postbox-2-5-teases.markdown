The Postbox team posted another tease for their upcoming redesign in version 2.5, this time the [new message view](http://www3.postbox-inc.com/?/blog/entry/postbox_2_5_-_message_view_redesign/).

I'm not going to re-post all of these, but I thought this one was worth pointing out because it shows some of the thinking behind the changes - and hints at an interesting design principle: 

_Detail views that don't change visual structure when the item they're displaying changes feel faster and more solid_.

Do you agree?
