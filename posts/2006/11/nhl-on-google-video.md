the sensation I felt when I noticed the announcement of NHL playoff video available on iTunes was that of Steve Jobs signing my name on a check for ten dollars and winking.




This weekend, when I saw this: [video.google.com/nhl.html](http://video.google.com/nhl.html) - free videos of every NHL game, including historic games, I went plain nuts. Go check it out, even if you don't know you like hockey yet. If you don't have a team, may I suggest the [Pittsburgh Penguins](http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=owner%3Anhl+penguins&hl=en&page=1&so=1)? There's probably still time to become a Penguins fan without being a bandwagon fan, but it's running out...
