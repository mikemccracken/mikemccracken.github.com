I had to look at some docs that were in Microsoft Help format - '.chm', or 'Compiled HTML'. It looks like a compressed, possibly indexed web archive format. Luckily, I only had to look for a minute before I found an OS X reader for CHM files that I like - [Chmox](http://chmox.sourceforge.net). It gives you the pages and the index, then basically gets out of your way.
