In case you had no idea what I was talking about in the [last post](http://michael-mccracken.net/wp/?p=61), I've put together a hasty screencast with no script, no soundtrack, and no editing.

In the video you can see a few things:

* *0:00*: I have found a way to show you the palm trees on my street without showing you the rest of my street. Lucky you!
* *0:08*: After I press control-z (not my final choice for a keystroke), we get a nice little display of sections in your file. Right now I have it set up to show me ObjC methods.
* *0:13*: It shows you where you are.
* *0:16*: ... and where you've been.
* *0:18*: you can jump around by clicking on the section header list.
* *0:30*: you can search through the contents and it shows which sections match.
* *0:38*: you can also choose from a list of other ways to slice your text - described by a bunch of regexps in a file you can tweak without recompiling the plugin.
* *0:49*: I use Snapz Pro X and Quicksilver, which you know because I also tried to use iMovie HD and couldn't find the "Don't make my imported movies look like crap" option, so I just uploaded the original movie with no funny titles. Bummer.

Also, the [leverage-discuss](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/leverage-discuss) mailing list is up now, if you want to ask how to use it.
