  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t normally post something about my weblog software, but I was apparently stumbling along with a really old wordpress that didn&rsquo;t accept new comments anymore, so I&rsquo;ve upgraded.</p>

<p>As a result my custom theme bit it, and I am fresh out of PHP edits. So I&rsquo;m trying this twitter-inspired thing out, the new &ldquo;P2&rdquo; theme for wordpress. It might make a good place for things that won&rsquo;t fit in twitter.</p>

<p>So say hi, leave a comment and let&rsquo;s do this thing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I use subversion, and won&rsquo;t switch to something newer for a while, so it&rsquo;s worth looking at how to polish that old hammer. I&rsquo;m used to using the command line svn, or emacs. But recently I decided to try out a few of the nice GUI clients that are around, including <a href="http://versionsapp.com/">Versions</a>, <a href="http://zigzig.com/">ZigVersion</a> and <a href="http://www.zennaware.com/cornerstone/">Cornerstone</a>.</p>

<p>Of these, the only one that&rsquo;s polished enough to lure me away from emacs and seems to support my favorite mode of working is Cornerstone, and it still gets it a little wrong.</p>

<p>I like to write log comments while looking at (and scrolling through) the diffs for the files I&rsquo;m committing. This means I want a text field for writing log comments on the same screen as the diffs, that isn&rsquo;t modal, and doesn&rsquo;t stop me from moving around between multiple diffs.</p>

<p>As far as I could tell, I couldn&rsquo;t get the comment field and the diff display shown together in Versions, and while I could in ZigVersion, that app had a subpar diff display and lacked polish overall, missing key shortcuts where I&rsquo;d expect them, for instance. Cornerstone almost lets me do what I want, but it displays the comment field in a modal sheet, so I have to cancel to change which diff I&rsquo;m looking at.</p>

<p>This is easy in emacs, but I like a nicer diff GUI. Am I just missing something? This feels like a natural workflow, so it seems strange that no clients support it well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Alex Payne&rsquo;s recent post <a href="http://al3x.net/2009/01/31/against-everything-buckets.html">The case against everything buckets</a> makes a strong point in favor of using the filesystem for filing. To paraphrase: If your problem is that you have a bunch of files you need to search through, and possibly tag, then the filesystem and Spotlight are probably closer to solving your problem than you expect.</p>

<p>I enjoyed reading his post, because I like rules of thumb for simple design, and one of my favorites is &ldquo;why not just use files?&rdquo; &ndash; there are often reasons to do something else, but the filesystem is faster, more reliable, and more open than anything you&rsquo;re likely to come up with on the first try. So you&rsquo;d better be sure you&rsquo;re not just poorly reimplementing it.</p>

<p>Buzz Andersen has a <a href="http://log.scifihifi.com/post/76989703/everything-buckets">thorough response</a>, centering on the fact that VoodooPad is a very useful app. Certainly I agree &ndash; I use it all the time, and its hyperlinking sets it apart from other notes apps (and the filesystem). So yes, VoodooPad is a Good Idea.</p>

<p>But is VoodooPad really an &ldquo;Everything Bucket&rdquo;? I&rsquo;m not sold &ndash; you can use it to store PDFs and images and other files, but it really focuses on pages, and those files are just attachments to your pages. I see it as a notes app. I think if your problem is keeping notes &ndash; with images if necessary, linking between them, and searching those notes, then VoodooPad is clearly better than the filesystem. But you don&rsquo;t have to put everything else in there too.</p>

<p>I agree with Alex that I don&rsquo;t want one program to keep everything in a proprietary database. I like apps that keep my files as files. (like <a href="http://c-command.com/eaglefiler/">EagleFiler</a>.) But I do want layers on top of the filesystem &ndash; you wouldn&rsquo;t want to use just files for email, for example.</p>

<p>The only solution that&rsquo;s always bad is the solution to someone else&rsquo;s problem.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve written here before about text fields, particularly the problem of having a good-looking &lsquo;display&rsquo; mode and a separate &lsquo;edit&rsquo; mode for data you don&rsquo;t edit so often, like in AddressBook.</p>

<p>The most recent version of iCal decided that events are write-once-read-many as well. You now have to use cmd-E to get into edit mode, while cmd-I just gives you a small display mode.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m mostly OK with that, although I find I edit events about as often as I look at their info windows &ndash; after editing I usually just deal with alarms, not the events themselves. The casual glance at the time and title is always enough &ndash; I think either you&rsquo;re looking at the time and title or you&rsquo;re editing. I don&rsquo;t see the appeal in the new &lsquo;info-only&rsquo; mode (if it&rsquo;s actually new &ndash; it seems new.)</p>

<p>However, the change does highlight the jumble of editable text fields and text-like fields in the edit window:
<a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/wp2/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/pastedgraphic-1.tiff"><img src="http://michael-mccracken.net/wp2/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/pastedgraphic-1.tiff" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/wp2/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/pastedgraphic.tiff"><img src="http://michael-mccracken.net/wp2/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/pastedgraphic.tiff" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The &ldquo;Add Attendees&rdquo; link and the &ldquo;None&rdquo; placeholder for url act the same &ndash; you click on them, and enter text.
One&rsquo;s a link and one&rsquo;s mute gray text. Why?
For my part, I think the gray text is too understated, and the link is too garish.</p>

<p>There are other differences: you can tab to the &ldquo;url&rdquo; field, but you can&rsquo;t tab to &ldquo;attendees&rdquo;&hellip; until you add one, then you can. Once you click on either of them, the url field pops up a plain white raised NSTextField, but the attendees field is sunken and translucent, apparently an NSTokenField?</p>

<p>Both of the blue links could also be buttons. I&rsquo;m still not completely sold on replacing buttons with links, but I can understand the trend. I think a small plus-sign button would be fine for &ldquo;Add File&rdquo;, though, and &ldquo;Attendees&rdquo; ought to be a text field. Why force the user to use the mouse when adding data to an event?</p>

<p>All in all, I think the &ldquo;Add Attendees&rdquo; link/field is pretty strange. I&rsquo;m curious if I missing a precedent somewhere.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometimes progress on a project for me consists of a few short bursts of activity in between stretches of waiting for some long-running thing to complete so I can figure out what I need to do with it next.</p>

<p>Because I always have more than one project going, I don&rsquo;t actually wait much. I just switch workspaces and try to make progress on the next thing. If I can&rsquo;t make progress on anything immediate, I&rsquo;ll end up checking email or looking up something for a side project.</p>

<p>This kind of multitasking is inefficient, but inevitable when I might have to wait for 20 minutes or more for a compute job or a compile to finish.</p>

<p>The problem with this approach is that the things I&rsquo;m waiting for often finish while I&rsquo;m off doing something else, and if I get too involved, the low-priority research or emails will eat up my day while the high-priority work sits waiting for me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve attacked this problem in the past when using OS X with <a href="gr">growl</a>, but I can&rsquo;t call growlnotify from remote systems. However, I just found <a href="dzen">dzen</a> for X Windows, a lightweight notification display utility that compiles easily on every system I&rsquo;ve tried, and works remotely with ssh X forwarding.</p>

<p>I wrote a simple script called <code>go</code>, which just executes its arguments and runs <code>dzen</code> when it&rsquo;s done. Now I type (for example) <code>go make</code> and I can switch over to something else, confident that I&rsquo;ll see a big popup window letting me know when I can get back to working on my highest priority project.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s basically the entire <code>go</code> script:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/ksh
echo $@
$@
echo $@ completed on `hostname` \
 | dzen2 -p -h 64 -bg darkblue
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s simple but it&rsquo;s working great for me. I&rsquo;ve tried some improvements like randomizing window placement to avoid overlapping notifications, but the simple version above really does all I need.</p>

<p>Finally, a couple of details. zsh always seems to want to spell-check &lsquo;go&rsquo;, so I really named it &lsquo;~/bin/executeAndNotify.sh&rsquo; and just aliased &lsquo;go&rsquo; to that.
Also, I&rsquo;ve found it can mess with shell quoting as is, so sometimes I have to do <code>'somecommand ; go echo done'</code>. If someone has a tip on getting the quoting right in the script, I&rsquo;d love to hear it. The problem crops up when you try something like &lsquo;go make CC=&ldquo;cc -g&rdquo;&rsquo; &ndash; the quotes don&rsquo;t make it through.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Daniel Jalkut just <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/481/it-should-be-free">wrote about</a> a desktop bookmarking app called <a href="http://codesorcery.net/pukka/">Pukka</a>, which despite being apparently nice enough to warrant a positive review, was simple enough that Leo Laporte wasn&rsquo;t comfortable just saying it cost $15. I felt like adding to the discussion after a few commenters described the app as trivial &ndash; in one case saying that any good programmer could write it in two hours.</p>

<p>This bothered me, so I downloaded Pukka and gave it a try. I was curious to see if it was indeed trivial.</p>

<p>While it definitely doesn&rsquo;t seem like the most feature-rich program up front, there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff in there &ndash; it works with more than one bookmarking site, it integrates with RSS readers, uses the OS X keychain, includes Bonjour discovery of nearby users, and has AppleScript support.</p>

<p>Further, it shows attention to detail. Although I may not agree with some of Justin&rsquo;s UI design choices, it&rsquo;s clear that he spent time thinking about bookmarking workflow. I know in some of my projects, just pondering design choices takes hours &ndash; drawing mockups, and trying things out.</p>

<p>End-user app development isn&rsquo;t just programming, and programming isn&rsquo;t just typing.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that that although you might be able to retype the code by hand in a few hours, Pukka represents a good chunk of serious work. I&rsquo;m sure the mac developers in the audience will agree &ndash; Applescript support alone is almost guaranteed to be more than two hours of work.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad that there&rsquo;s a market for small apps and small developers, and I hope downwards price pressure from large subsidized or bundled apps doesn&rsquo;t kill that off.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>From Flying Meat, <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad">VoodooPad</a> 3.5 is out.
(<a href="http://www.flyingmeat.com/fs/flystashweb.cgi/2dc35f78-ac3e-01dc-01d4-c0cbe4c4bd91">release notes here</a>).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a solid update, including welcome image-editor integration and more. I thought I&rsquo;d point out my favorite feature in the release notes:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can now edit pages and sort the results in the search window (woo!).&rdquo;</p>

<p>I like this because it matches a kind of manual refactoring habit I picked up with Project Builder / XCode&rsquo;s excellent &ldquo;Find in Project…&rdquo; window &ndash; I search for a keyword that marks places I need to look at and edit the files right in the search window. (Note: <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Other-Repeating-Search.html">&lsquo;occur-mode&rsquo; and kin</a> are a powerful way to do the same in Emacs…)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a powerful habit if you plan for it, by using comments in code to keep track of what you&rsquo;ve touched when making a lot of cross-cutting changes, like <code># @addsearch</code> Then when you think you&rsquo;re done with a change, you can run a quick search to see if you forgot to fix anything.</p>

<p>Sometimes in VoodooPad notes, I&rsquo;ll write in placeholders like that comment when I don&rsquo;t have a bit of information yet, and now I can follow my trails the same way I do in code.</p>

<p>Thanks, Gus!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been hacking around with <a href="http://pyobjc.sf.net">PyObjC</a>, the Python-ObjC/Cocoa bridge recently, and it&rsquo;s quickly becoming my favorite way to write Cocoa apps. It&rsquo;s really natural to mix Python idioms with Cocoa objects.</p>

<p>The latest version of PyObjC is 2.0, it&rsquo;s installed by default on OS X 10.5, and XCode now includes templates for starting a PyObjC project. There&rsquo;s even code autocomplete in XCode for PyObjC and IB integration, so aside from some smart-indenting issues, writing PyObjC in XCode is almost as natural as writing in ObjC.</p>

<p>I thought I&rsquo;d post a few nice shortcuts and tips here.</p>

<p>You can use tuples for NSRect/Range/Point, for instance, this &ndash;</p>

<pre><code>r = NSInsetRect(((0, 0) ,
                 (100, 100)),
                10, 10)
</code></pre>

<p>creates this NSRect &ndash;</p>

<pre><code>NSRect origin=
       size=&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Passing python arrays as NSArray instances (and dictionaries as NSDictionaries) works great, but sometimes you need to pass a C array. The Python &lsquo;array&rsquo; module handles that nicely:</p>

<pre><code>import array
g = NSGradient.alloc().
   initWithColors_locations_colorSpace_(
    [NSColor.whiteColor(),
     NSColor.blackColor()],   

    array.array('f', [0.0, 1.0]),
    NSColorSpace.deviceRGBColorSpace())
</code></pre>

<p>ObjC selectors are just python strings in PyObjC.</p>

<pre><code>defNC.addObserver_selector_name_object_(self,
  'windowDidResize:',
  NSWindowDidResizeNotification,
  self)
# or
self.performSelectorOnMainThread_withObject_waitUntilDone_('doIt:', None, False)
# or
if o.respondsToSelector_("fun:"): return o.fun_(a)
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, something that comes in handy when working with KVC, the  &lsquo;_&rsquo; method now defined on NSObjects in PyObjC:</p>

<pre><code>o = 
print o._.myKey
o._.myKey = 44
# is equivalent to:
print o.valueForKey_('myKey')
o.setValue_forKey_(44, 'myKey')
</code></pre>

<p>That last example is straight from the <a href="http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/NEWS-2.0.html">NEWS page</a>, where lots of other useful info can be found.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been looking around for some more detailed information about the &ldquo;Site Reliability Engineering&rdquo; positions at Google.
Apparently the role is a real mix of very large-scale system administration, planning and automation.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve collected some links to public info about the job.</p>

<p>The Google channel has <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y31STIrwtlk">a promotional video</a> from one engineer about the role &ndash; he tells a quick story about being on call to monitor and address problems with Google talk.</p>

<p>A set of <a href="http://www.ukuug.org/events/spring2007/programme/ThatCouldntHappenToUs.pdf">slides from a talk by James Youngman</a> at the UK Unix &amp; Open Systems User&rsquo;s Group gives a good description of the general task, and dives deeper into two specific examples &ndash; powering down failed disks, and protecting data with checksums, exploring how straightforward ideas can explode at scale.
(These slides also have potentially the best proprietary-information disclaimer I&rsquo;ve ever seen: &ldquo;This has been written entirely in ASCII. No EBCDIC or animal fat.&rdquo;)</p>

<p><a href="http://sysadmin.miniconf.org/2006/pollmann_google_lightning_talk.ppt">Here</a> is another set of slides with a quick overview, from a &lsquo;lightning talk&rsquo;.</p>

<p>A sampling of what Google SRE engineers put in their public resumes about their job includes quite a span &ndash; from troubleshooting mission critical services to writing automation software (in Python).</p>

<p>And finally, an <a href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/03/hiring-lake-wobegon-strategy.html">interesting post from 2006</a> about the theory behind Google&rsquo;s hiring strategy, summarized as &ldquo;only hire candidates who are above the mean of your current employees&rdquo;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://twitter.com/dacort">Damon Cortesi</a> just shared a handy script for grabbing your tweets and compiling some stats about when you post to twitter and who you reply to.</p>

<p>His script generates a list of numbers and included a Numbers template to paste them into. Since I don&rsquo;t have Numbers, I&rsquo;ve modified <a href="http://dcortesi.com/2007/12/27/twitter-stats/">his script</a> to write a file that can be read by <a href="http://gnuplot.info">gnuplot</a>, and wrote a basic gnuplot script to output an SVG file version of the stats.</p>

<p>While I was at it, I changed it so it no longer counts &ldquo;@someone&rdquo; separately from &ldquo;@someone:&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Both scripts are right here &ndash; <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/twitter/gnuplot_twitterstats.tgz">gnuplot_twitterstats.tgz</a></p>

<p>It uses gnuplot 4.2, which you can get on OS X with <a href="http://www.macports.org/">macports</a> using <code>port install gnuplot +no_x11'</code>. (Or it&rsquo;s a pretty easy build on its own, see the <a href="http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/download.html">gnuplot download page</a> )</p>

<p>Here are my stats:
Sorry, it looks like your browser doesn&rsquo;t support SVG. You&rsquo;re really not missing much.
