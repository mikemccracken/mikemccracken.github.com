  MarsEdit 1.1.2
    ](http://ranchero.com/marsedit/)

MarsEdit was recently [updated to version 1.1.2](http://ranchero.com/?comments=1&postid=1306), with a few bug fixes. I really like MarsEdit -  It does what I need and stays out of my way. I'm not the most demanding user - I have one WordPress weblog and don't keep up with the latest in blogging tools. I did have my own customized weblog editor, Blapp, that I used for years, so I was expecting to find plenty of things that annoyed me about a program that wasn't written just for me. To my surprise, it felt comfortable right away - I got started posting with MarsEdit quickly, and haven't had to learn about all kinds of features that I don't use. Thumbs up.
