    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some great samples and historical tidbits from Fresh Air: <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/03/18/134652613/before-ipanema-stan-getzs-exquisite-quintets?ft=1&amp;f;=13&amp;sc;=17">Before Ipanema: Stan Getz&rsquo;s exquisite quintets</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Before he was famous for popularizing bossa nova with &ldquo;The Girl from Ipanema&rdquo; in the early 1960s, saxophonist Stan Getz recorded with small jazz groups all through the &lsquo;50s. Jazz critic Kevin Whitehead says a new reissue shows Getz was one of the best at playing pretty.</p></blockquote>

<p>I really love Fresh Air. I used to listen to it every day after school while playing Crystal Quest in my room. Every time I hear Terry Gross' voice, I get a bit of a rush like I&rsquo;m goofing off instead of doing my homework.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been mentioned before, for example <a href="http://digg.com/apple/New_iTunes_7_SKIP_COUNT_feature">on Digg</a>, but iTunes 7 has a new feature that counts the number of times you&rsquo;ve <em>skipped</em> a track, which is defined as playing the song for at least two seconds but no longer than twenty (after which it is counted as played fully).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m curious how they chose twenty seconds as the cutoff &ndash; when I was working on an (unreleased and unfinished) project for generating smart shuffles, I defined skips as not listening past the first fifteen seconds, but didn&rsquo;t count a full play until the song ended.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting feature, and it&rsquo;s apparently kept up to date by some iPods, so I can see it helping me keep bad songs off my small iPod by using it in a smart playlist rule. However, often I find myself skipping songs I really like because I&rsquo;m just not feeling them at the moment. So &ndash; how about the option of a smart playlist rule that lets me define a skip percentage? If I skip a song far more often than I play it, then it&rsquo;s a pretty good bet I don&rsquo;t need it on my iPod.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I meant to post this just after the show, but I didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>I saw <a href="http://mattpondpa.com/">Matt Pond PA</a> play on March 7th at the Epicentre in Mira Mesa.</p>

<p>The band sounded great, fitting a sometimes symphonic sound from a few band members into a smallish low-ceilinged venue (okay, teen center). I was impressed that their sometimes melancholy songs translated so well to a live performance, and as usual it was fantastic to see actual people play favorite familiar songs in person. As compared to their albums, live, they <em>rocked</em> a little more &ndash; which is only right.</p>

<p>However, the band fails to even mention the date on their running tour blog, and I think I know why. Mira Mesa in general, and the Epicentre in particular, occupy an all-too familiar spot right in the nexus of <em>lame</em>. It&rsquo;s hard for me not to feel a little sad whenever I drive through the place, a plateau of asphalt wedged between freeways and topped with a layer-cake of condos, strip malls and &ldquo;communities&rdquo;. The Epicentre is not a bar or any kind of concert hall &ndash; it is a teen center directly across from the local high school. The bathrooms smelled like chalk and institutional cleaners, and although I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d have visited the place if it&rsquo;d existed near my high school, it was clearly trying too hard to be both cool and safe, two things which can never coexist, especially if you&rsquo;re a minor.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a little embarrassed for my adopted city because too many bands will experience San Diego as a place where they draw ten percent of their usual crowds and are forced to play at the diner from Saved by the Bell.</p>

<p>In summary, Matt Pond PA was very good, and I really hope they don&rsquo;t hold a grudge.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I bought three new albums with my iTunes gift card this Christmas, and I thought I&rsquo;d share how they&rsquo;ve turned out so far:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Takk… by Sigur Ros. I bought this because I liked their last album, the parentheses one, and because John Allison&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.scarygoround.com/?date=20051226">hilarious year end album review</a> seemed to imply it was more of the same: &ldquo;Everyone is fooled!&rdquo; I find that I do like it just as much, but unlike all those Untitled songs in the last one, I don&rsquo;t mind listening to these songs when the sun is out. A fun game for casual fans is to play songs from the two albums together at random, and try to guess which album they&rsquo;re from. I call this the &ldquo;Coldplay game&rdquo;.</p></li>
<li><p>Late Registration by Kanye West. Everyone says it&rsquo;s great, and I don&rsquo;t listen to radio or watch MTV anyway, so I can&rsquo;t be annoyed by overplayed singles. I really like this album. Great for playing really loud while driving someone else&rsquo;s car across the desert at perfectly legal speeds. Luckily I live in Southern California, so nobody looks at me funny when my pale white fingers crank the volume on the way to my hockey game. I think my favorite track here is &ldquo;Addiction&rdquo;.</p></li>
<li><p>Final Straw by Snow Patrol. I&rsquo;ve listened to it a few times already, it seems like there&rsquo;s a few great songs in there, a few I won&rsquo;t ever remember, and I have a nagging feeling that this will become another Josh Joplin Group, who I loved for three weeks and almost always skip past now. Which would be sad. If there was one song to get from this album, I think it&rsquo;d be &ldquo;Chocolate&rdquo;, not &ldquo;Run&rdquo;, which was the big single. So there it is.</p></li>
</ol>
