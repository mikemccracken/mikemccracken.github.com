My shared links for April 4th:






  * [Stuart's "Law of Networkdynamics"](http://www.stuartcheshire.org/rants/Networkdynamics.html) - 


  * [Flattr - Social micropayments](https://flattr.com/) - An interesting model that I hadn't heard of. You set a monthly amount to spend and when you see a flattr button, you click on it. They then divide your monthly amount among the people you clicked on that month.

Sounds great but I have never seen a button, unless it's been hidden among many other warts.


  * [Haskell: Functional Programming, Solid Code, Big Data (1)](http://bos.github.com/strange-loop-2011/slides/slides.html#(1)) - Bryan O'Sullivan's Haskell tutorial from Strange Loop 2011


  * [QuickCheck | YELLOSOFT](http://www.yellosoft.us/quickcheck) - Lots of ports of QuickCheck


  * [Simple Quickcheck implementation for Python](http://dan.bravender.us/2009/6/21/Simple_Quickcheck_implementation_for_Python.html) - Random test generation that is not as nice as Haskell's quickcheck but will do the job.
