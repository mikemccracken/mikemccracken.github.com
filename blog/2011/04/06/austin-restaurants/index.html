<div class="entry-content"><p>Last year, I wrote up a list of restaurants I&#8217;d recommend in Austin for an intern from California who was going to spend all summer here and needed to know what not to miss out on.</p>

<p>This is not just places around downtown. In fact it&#8217;s weighted toward North Austin, if anything - only because that&#8217;s where I live and work, not because the best restaurants are there. They&#8217;re not.</p>

<p>This list probably won&#8217;t help if you&#8217;re just in town for a conference, but in case you&#8217;re moving to Austin, or staying for longer than a week - here are some places you ought to try.</p>

<p>These descriptions might make more sense to you if you&#8217;re from California, but I&#8217;d say the recommendations stand wherever you&#8217;re coming from.</p>

<p>Since this is mostly just transcribed from an email I wrote last year while waiting for something to compile, I&#8217;m missing Hopdoddy (best burgers ever, on South Congress) and G&#8217;Raj Mahal (Indian food trailer with beautiful outdoor seating, near downtown), which are now in my top five.
Or the pizza slice place that we just found. And I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve left out the Steeping Room tea house in the domain mall, which we visit about once a week on average. But the list is what it is. Maybe I&#8217;ll expand it into a whole guide some day.</p>

<p>EDIT: David the intern also found his own gems to share &#8211; including Noble Pig, a fantastic sandwich shop. I should also mention <a href="http://www.gourdoughs.com">Gourdough&#8217;s</a>, a donut trailer on south Lamar that has to be seen to be believed. Fresh hot large donuts with mind-blowing toppings, some savory, some alcoholic!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m happy to hear suggestions in the comments. Meanwhile - here&#8217;s the list:</p>

<h2>Tex-Mex</h2>

<p>I am guessing that coming from California, you&#8217;ll be used to mexican food, maybe seafood-heavy baja mex food.</p>

<p>In Texas, good mexican food can be found but more common (and more uniquely Texas) is tex-mex.
And it&#8217;s good - please forget everything you might have learned about &#8220;tex-mex&#8221; from places like Chili&#8217;s.</p>

<p>One of the hallmarks of tex-mex vs. cali mexican food is queso (aka cheese sauce) - the best stuff is pretty spicy.
Also, you&#8217;ll see more Jalapeños than other peppers. I think serrano peppers are more common in baja mex.
There&#8217;s more of a focus on enchiladas and tacos than burritos - you&#8217;ll be hard pressed to find a &#8220;burrito place&#8221; like the ones all over California.</p>

<p>A few great local tex-mex institutions within a short drive of North Austin:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.trudys.com/locations_north.htm">Trudy&#8217;s North</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Great fajitas</li>
<li>Try the migas - something I&#8217;ve only seen in Texas so far: it&#8217;s scrambled eggs with queso and tortillas. Excellent comfort food for brunch.</li>
<li>You can mix the two and get the migas fajitas. worth a try.</li>
<li>Other things worth knowing about - their fried stuffed avocado, their lunchtime buffet that lets you sample from most of their menu (amazing, come hungry, leave Texan)</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://chuys.com/#/austin">Chuy&#8217;s</a>: A chain, there&#8217;s one on 183 in North Austin and a few others around</p>

<ul>
<li>great enchiladas (try the ones called &#8220;chicka-boom&#8221; or something)</li>
<li>great chips and decent salsa</li>
<li>very good margaritas that work</li>
<li>good happy hour ($3.50 margaritas)</li>
<li>the place can get pretty crowded. Apply margaritas and wait.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Tacos</h2>

<p>Instead of burrito places, austin has taco joints. The two best are Torchy&#8217;s and Tacodeli:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.torchystacos.com/">Torchy&#8217;s</a></p>

<ul>
<li>This place is a revelation, it&#8217;s rightfully famous and is almost certainly better than you imagine a &#8220;taco place&#8221; can be - no matter how much mexican food you&#8217;ve had.</li>
<li>the one nearest North Austin is &#8220;torchy&#8217;s spicewood&#8221;. It&#8217;s more or less along mopac (Loop 1).</li>
<li>try a couple variations. If you ask me, they don&#8217;t make a bad taco.</li>
<li>their current monthly taco is always worth checking out - for example, an occasional monthly fave is a chicken-fried-steak taco called &#8220;the double-wide&#8221;. Don&#8217;t miss out.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://www.tacodeli.com/">Tacodeli</a></p>

<ul>
<li>This place is not the culinary star that Torchy&#8217;s is, but it&#8217;s a great option for lunch and has a couple of standout items, including the Molé tacos and the Tortas.</li>
<li>There are a few around - the one in North Austin is along Mopac, close to the Domain mall and IBM, National Instruments, etc..</li>
<li>More variety than torchy&#8217;s - I&#8217;ve also never had a bad taco here.</li>
<li>A nice variety of salsas, but disappointing store-bought chips. Total missed opportunity. Just get the tacos.</li>
</ul>


<h2>BBQ</h2>

<p>You can find a lot of opinions about barbecue. I suggest you try as many places as you can find - and there are plenty. Rudy&#8217;s is a large local chain that&#8217;s visible along 183 in North Austin, and often recommended. I actually think that Rudy&#8217;s, while good, is kind of the McDonald&#8217;s of decent barbecue. OK, maybe better, because I&#8217;ll still go there occasionally.</p>

<p><a href="http://rubysbbq.com">Ruby&#8217;s</a></p>

<ul>
<li>My personal favorite in town is Ruby&#8217;s near UT. It&#8217;s small, a little grungy, and fantastic.</li>
<li>great brisket, amazing ribs</li>
<li>Their sides are pretty good too - I like both kinds of their slaw, and their beans are good n&#8217; spicy</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://www.saltlickbbq.com/">Salt Lick</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Of course, if you want to take a trip, the salt lick is legendary. It&#8217;s miles out of town in a dry county, and it&#8217;s been on  TV a bunch of times.</li>
<li>Their sauce is unique - kind of mustardy, really delicious.</li>
<li>Make sure you get a sampling of the different meats - their sides aren&#8217;t that good, &#8216;cause they&#8217;re not the point.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://www.countyline.com/index.asp">County Line</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Finally, closest to North Austin, the County Line BBQ chain has a restaurant near highway 360 and FM2222 called &#8220;county line on the lake&#8221; - and it is really right on the lake.</li>
<li>You can sit outside and order from a patio menu with a BBQ sampler.</li>
<li>The bbq is good (as good or better than Rudy&#8217;s) but the ambiance is why I&#8217;d go.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fancy date places</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.eddiev.com/">Eddie V&#8217;s</a></p>

<ul>
<li>really great seafood &amp; steaks</li>
<li>there&#8217;s one downtown and one in the arboretum (North Austin)</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://www.shorelinegrill.com/">Shoreline grill</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Downtown, good food, view of town lake and the bats coming from the bridge.</li>
<li>Once I ordered a caprese salad and I think they used chocolate sauce instead of balsamic. But the food there is usually so good that I wasn&#8217;t sure it was a mistake. So that&#8217;s saying something, right?</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://www.uchiaustin.com/">Uchi</a></p>

<ul>
<li>world-class sushi (really! I&#8217;ve had actual good sushi and this is it. I&#8217;m surprised too.)</li>
<li>expensive, but a real experience. We went there for our wedding anniversary and it was fantastic.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://www.paggihouse.com/">Paggi House</a></p>

<ul>
<li>More excellent fine cuisine. Probably my favorite fine-dining restaurant in Austin that isn&#8217;t Uchi.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://www.finoaustin.com/fino/">Fino</a></p>

<ul>
<li>A good tapas place in Central Austin.</li>
<li>They&#8217;ve usually got some inventive seasonal dishes, and usually something great for an appetizer.</li>
<li>I seem to recall lots of great cheeses.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://www.finoaustin.com/asti/">Asti</a></p>

<ul>
<li>A modern italian place by the same folks behind Asti. In a charming part of Central Austin called Hyde Park.</li>
<li>Really perfectly done food. Great place, crowded seating, always full - kind of feels like a hot new restaurant in a bigger city.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Texas comfort food</h2>

<p>There&#8217;s a style of &#8220;Texas home cookin&#8217;&#8221; restaurant that&#8217;s really worth giving a try. Here are two off the top of my head:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.threadgills.com/">Threadgill&#8217;s</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Interestingly, also a historic music venue where Janis Joplin sang.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re up for it, their chicken fried steak is an excellent example of the genre.
(Chicken-fried steak, also known as &#8220;CFS&#8221;, sometimes painted on the sides of small-town diners along the highway, is a real texas staple)</li>
<li>Also, good pies, and cheap Lonestar beers.</li>
<li>They have a &#8220;Howdy Hour&#8221;. Enough said?</li>
</ul>


<h2>Ice cream</h2>

<p><a href="http://amysicecreams.com/">Amy&#8217;s ice cream</a>
A local institution. they have great ice cream, but for me the real draw is that their rotating flavors always include two with some kind of alcohol flavor - the beer ice creams are great (they have Shiner, Live Oak and Guinness ice cream. Live Oak is my fave of those)</p>

<h2>Breakfast Tacos</h2>

<p>For some reason, the california burrito bias extends to breakfast, so this was a new thing for me.
It&#8217;s a big deal here - every mexican place, coffee shop, lots of burger joints, and even a few BBQ places and gas stations will serve you a cheap egg n&#8217; something taco. They can be a delicious option for breakfast, and way less of a weighty decision than the breakfast burrito you might be used to in california.</p>

<p>But - maybe start with a known good place (Torchy&#8217;s, for example), before trying out those gas station tacos.</p>

<h2>Burritos</h2>

<p>As I mentioned before, burritos really aren&#8217;t where it&#8217;s at here. Not sure why.</p>

<p>If you crave a California-style burrito, the closest I&#8217;ve been able to find is <a href="http://www.ilovesuperburrito.com/">Super Burrito</a> in south austin.</p>

<p>Everything I had there was good, and it was exactly like I was back in pacific beach.
A bit of a drive, though, and zero ambiance.</p>
