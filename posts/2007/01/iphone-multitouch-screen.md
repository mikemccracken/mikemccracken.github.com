If you're wondering how well the multitouch-screen will work on the iPhone UI, especially for typing, assuming that Apple really did [buy Fingerworks](http://fingerfans.dreamhosters.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=223), I can [testify](http://michael-mccracken.net/blog/blosxom.pl/computers/meetFingerworksLP.html) that the technology they developed to auto-correct typing on a keyless sensor surface works much better than you would expect. It really is the kind of thing you need to try to believe, and if the iPhone uses that technology, I don't think we'll be seeing any ["egg freckles"](http://images.ucomics.com/comics/db/1993/db930827.gif) this time.
