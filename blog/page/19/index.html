  <div class="entry-content"><p>Andy Ihnatko paints <a href="http://www.macuser.com/ihnatko/ihnatko_harsh_words_for_window.php">a colorful picture of Windows use</a>. He describes Windows as first the boorish, greasy haired acquaintance on a long road-trip, then later as disposable underpants. I can&#8217;t resist anthropomorphizations and descriptions of software as other daily objects.</p>

<p>I wasn&#8217;t going to post that article, but just now I was keeping notes in Notepad and wanted to write something unrelated down quickly, so I press control-N. You know, &#8220;New&#8221;. A dialog box pops up, and before I realize it, I&#8217;ve lost the notes I was keeping, because I accidentally hit &#8220;No&#8221; in response to &#8220;Do you want to save the changes?&#8221;. OK, my mistake, but in my defense, I wasn&#8217;t expecting that decision and didn&#8217;t really read the dialog box, surely the twentieth dialog I&#8217;ve seen in two hours.</p>

<p>Also, why am I closing one file to open a new one? In Firefox, if I press control-N, I get a new window and my old one is still there. What&#8217;s the deal, Notepad? Do most real Windows users just never use you?</p>

<p>I miss VoodooPad.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thanks to <a href="http://gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2006/09/my_dream_app_voting.html">Gus</a>,
I took a quick tour through the <a href="http://mydreamapp.com">MyDreamApp</a> finalists today, and voted for two of them, Portal and Blossom. Portal is a long shot - it&#8217;s basically proposing to solve multi-computer file syncing seamlessly, but it would be great if done right. See Wil Shipley&#8217;s comments for why it&#8217;s hard. Merging is not easy.</p>

<p>Blossom is a great idea to link productivity nannying with emotional appeal - work hard and your desktop plant grows! It needs a new name, but with the right design and art, I think it&#8217;d be a hit. If they took a cue from the Nike+iPod <a href="http://www.cabel.name/2006/08/multiplayer-game-of-year.html">multiplayer game</a>, we could compete on productivity - make work a game and compete to see who can build the biggest, healthiest desktop plant. Brilliant!</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s <em>Windows User Fun Fact:</em> I had to use Internet Explorer to see the entries on the MyDreamApp page - Firefox didn&#8217;t show the entry details when I clicked on the pictures.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been a Windows User for two weeks now. Since <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/wp/?p=64">my powerbook disk died</a>, I&#8217;ve been working on a loaner Dell Lattitude with XP.</p>

<p>I get by. It&#8217;s not as hard as I would have guessed. Most of my work these days just needs a decent terminal, and SSH from ssh.com (who knew there was a commercial SSH?) works OK. I don&#8217;t understand why it doesn&#8217;t save my keyboard preferences, but I muddle through.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m using <a href="http://www.washington.edu/pine/">pine</a> for email, and the lack of <a href="http://c-command.com/spamsieve">SpamSieve</a> is shockingly obvious. Sometimes control characters in spam emails garble the screen so badly that I can&#8217;t tell what I&#8217;m deleting.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I use Firefox, and Google calendar keeps my schedule. So far, I haven&#8217;t missed my iCal integration applescripts (<a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/blog/blosxom.pl/computers/mac/todoQuickSilver.html">new-todo-in-quicksilver</a>,
<a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/blog/blosxom.pl/computers/mac/programming/ASiCal.html">new-event-from-email</a>, and <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/wp/?p=30">new-todo-from-email</a>), but I&#8217;m sure I will if this goes on longer.</p>

<p>I miss the years of notes I had inVoodooPad. In its place, I&#8217;ve been using emacs org-mode in a terminal. I like the outlining and todo/agenda gathering it can do, and wouldn&#8217;t be opposed to similar features in VoodooPad. I&#8217;d actually been using it in the weeks before my forced <em>switch</em>, but just for the todos.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve accidentally tried to print about a hundred times when editing text, expecting the old emacs shortcuts to be there. This is OK, though, because I can&#8217;t configure printers.</p>

<p>There is a similar story for almost every key shortcut I want to use - I have no idea how to switch between tabs in Firefox, and when I did find out how to minimize windows from the keyboard (Alt-space, &#8216;n&#8217;), I wished I hadn&#8217;t, because it only works in half of the programs I use.</p>

<p>One thing Windows does is make me want to give up earlier. I actually just don&#8217;t care if I can&#8217;t figure out a good way to do something. This is an exciting new feeling - I just give up and get back to work, and each time, I feel a little more like a real grownup. You know, how you feel after all your youthful dreams have died.</p>

<p>I get more done at work with Windows. I no longer install programs just to try them out (scary!), or hack on minor projects (no friendly tools built-in). Even just surfing around is just not as tempting, and I do less of it, both at work and at home. In moments of weakness, I have considered swapping my PowerBook for three pound Windows laptop, just so I can finish sooner and with better posture. I know I could never do it, but the thought lingers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been thinking of how I&#8217;d work if I didn&#8217;t have a laptop. One thing&#8217;s for sure: I wouldn&#8217;t spend as much time rubbing my neck while waiting for builds, for a couple of reasons.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m beginning to wonder if a laptop is really any good at all, let alone necessary. Wouldn&#8217;t I rather not carry that thing around all the time? Should my hands really sweat when my <em>computer</em> is working hard? Doesn&#8217;t having a laptop just give me an excuse to pretend I&#8217;ll be able keep working &#8220;later&#8221;, even though that never really works? Does anyone really gain more <em>productivity</em> from working at a coffee shop than they would using a fast desktop computer?</p>

<p>I think the one thing my laptop is best at is blurring the line between <em>fun</em> and <em>work</em>, and not in a good way for either.</p>

<p>With the heat, weight, relatively poor performance, and especially the paranoia from carrying such an expensive thing around, I&#8217;ve grown to seriously resent my Powerbook, despite being at quite a loss without it.</p>

<p>Has anyone found a good way around the extreme dependence on heavy, fragile, hot-plate laptops, and still been able to get things done in more than one place? Anyone carrying Mac minis around between monitors? Carrying a disk between minis? Strict work/home division? What&#8217;s your scheme?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My Powerbook&#8217;s disk died yesterday around 1pm. Since then I&#8217;ve been thinking about how to get by without it.
After taking far too long to realize it was beyond my troubleshooting ability, I took it to the UTC Apple store at 5 or so, and got an appointment for 7:45, then went for a drink. When I came back, the Apple store guy referred me to drivesavers - I&#8217;ll have to see what their estimate is when they call me back. For now, I assume I&#8217;ll have to pay whatever they ask - I was careful about backing up notes and papers to my iDisk and keeping important work files in repositories on other machines, but there is still a lot of stuff on that machine that I can&#8217;t replace, and my full-backup scheme was just inconvenient enough (and my target disk just small enough) that my full backup is pretty stale.</p>

<p>I can keep working for now on lab computers and my old home Mac - I&#8217;m pretty impressed with how much I can just transfer over to another mac and keep running - I can check all my mail (IMAP or GMail), read my NetNewsWire subscriptions (Newsgator Online), go through my bookmarks (iSync &amp; .mac). Pretty impressive, even without any effort to stay flexible.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s hoping I can be back on track soon - for now I&#8217;m only a Mac user at nights, and I&#8217;m going to miss a few things during the days, to be sure.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For my first contribution to <a href="http://bibdesk.sf.net">BibDesk</a> in a while, I&#8217;ve added the ability to read Dublin Core metadata when it is encoded in HTML META tags on a web page.</p>

<p>What this means is that when using the &#8220;New Publications from Web&#8221; feature, some sites you browse to will have the publication&#8217;s information filled in for you, so you don&#8217;t have to type anything at all. The <a href="http://www.eprints.org/">Eprints.org</a> open archive software does this, so check out their <a href="http://www.eprints.org/software/archives/">list of archives</a> for examples to test it out on.</p>

<p>It&#8217;ll be in the next version, which isn&#8217;t scheduled yet, so if you&#8217;d like to try it out sooner, see the <a href="http://bibdesk.demokratia.org/beta/">nightly builds</a> page and heed its warnings.</p>

<p>If you publish web sites with one-page-per-pubcation and want info about embedding DC terms in your meta tags, see the <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcq-html/">Dublin Core recommendation</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to support AutoFill for a site that doesn&#8217;t have one page per publication, or would like to provide more metadata, I suggest waiting for the <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/citation">citation microformat</a>. Feel free to ask why&#8230;</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: I made a 12-second movie of how it works - <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/img/BibDesk-DCHTML-screencast.mov">BibDesk, EPrints and Dublin Core</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In case you had no idea what I was talking about in the <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/wp/?p=61">last post</a>, I&#8217;ve put together a hasty screencast with no script, no soundtrack, and no editing.</p>

<p><a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/img/textstructure-screencast.mov">
<img src="http://michael-mccracken.net/img/textstructure-screencast-snap.png" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>In the video you can see a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>0:00</em>: I have found a way to show you the palm trees on my street without showing you the rest of my street. Lucky you!</li>
<li><em>0:08</em>: After I press control-z (not my final choice for a keystroke), we get a nice little display of sections in your file. Right now I have it set up to show me ObjC methods.</li>
<li><em>0:13</em>: It shows you where you are.</li>
<li><em>0:16</em>: &#8230; and where you&#8217;ve been.</li>
<li><em>0:18</em>: you can jump around by clicking on the section header list.</li>
<li><em>0:30</em>: you can search through the contents and it shows which sections match.</li>
<li><em>0:38</em>: you can also choose from a list of other ways to slice your text - described by a bunch of regexps in a file you can tweak without recompiling the plugin.</li>
<li><em>0:49</em>: I use Snapz Pro X and Quicksilver, which you know because I also tried to use iMovie HD and couldn&#8217;t find the &#8220;Don&#8217;t make my imported movies look like crap&#8221; option, so I just uploaded the original movie with no funny titles. Bummer.</li>
</ul>


<p>Also, the <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/leverage-discuss">leverage-discuss</a> mailing list is up now, if you want to ask how to use it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>13 months ago, I <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/blog/blosxom.pl/computers/mac/programming/meetLeverage.html">&#8220;launched&#8221;</a> the <a href="http://leverage.sourceforge.net">leverage project</a> on sourceforge, supposed to be a place to house all the various OS X / Cocoa text manipulation hacks I&#8217;ve done, including my I-Search for NSTextView InputManager hack.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t touched leverage since, but today I added three more projects to the SVN repository with varying appeal and usability. I also added a mailing list, <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/leverage-discuss">leverage-discuss</a>.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re interested in trying these out or working on one of these hacks, and want to ask a question, using that email list would be best, but you can also <a href="mailto:michael_mccracken@mac.com">email me</a> directly about them.</p>

<h4>TextShape</h4>

<p>Here&#8217;s my 2004 blog post about it: <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/blog/blosxom.pl/computers/mac/programming/meetTSV.html">&#8220;Usability and Editing Code: TextShapeView&#8221;</a> and here&#8217;s the old home page for it, with a screenshot: <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/?TextShapeView">TextShapeView</a>.</p>

<p>The code is unchanged, but it works fine on 10.4.</p>

<p><a href="http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/leverage/textshape/trunk/">http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/leverage/textshape/trunk/</a></p>

<h4>TextStructure</h4>

<p>A long time ago, so long I can&#8217;t even find it with google, I posted somewhere about a hacked version of <a href="http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~koch/texshop">TexShop</a> that had an outline view in a drawer that showed the section structure of your TeX document.</p>

<p>I never got that working well enough to try adding it to TexShop, but I did realize that it&#8217;s something that could be useful for other kinds of text as well.</p>

<p>A big project, the TextStructure InputManager adds a key binding to NSTextView that pops up a window with an outline view that tries to represent the current text as an outline, using a scheme of regular expressions that mark some lines of text as &#8220;tags&#8221; with outline levels, depending on the text. It has a few regexps built in for LaTeX, ObjC, TODO &amp; FIXME lines, and email quoting (which doesn&#8217;t quite make sense).</p>

<p>You can also search the text for a regexp, and it will highlight the sections which contain a match.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t have a screenshot just yet, but I&#8217;ll post about it more later.</p>

<p><a href="http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/leverage/textstructure/trunk/">http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/leverage/textstructure/trunk/</a></p>

<h4>OEM : Open in Emacs</h4>

<p>This is a new one, and a work-in-progress. It adds a key binding to open the text of the current text view in an emacs buffer, using a temporary file and <code>emacsclient</code>. It currently has no way to get the text back into the text view from the file when you&#8217;re done editing it in emacs, and doesn&#8217;t delete the file. But it&#8217;s at least partially nifty&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/leverage/oem/trunk/">http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/leverage/oem/trunk/</a></p>

<h4>ISIM: Incremental Search in NSTextView</h4>

<p>Not new, but it&#8217;s in there too:

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been using Red Sweater software&#8217;s <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/flextime/">FlexTime</a> for a while now, and Daniel just announced version 1.0.</p>

<p>FlexTime is a repeating-timer program that is great for either set routines or one-off reminders. (It also has a pretty great name, don&#8217;t you think?)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a solid program that you can use for a number of things. It fills an important niche I care about - helping you deal with your #1 work tool also being your #1 toy.</p>

<p>I use it to do a version of the <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/10/11/procrastination-hack-1025/">&#8220;(10+2)*&#8221;</a> procrastination hack that helps me get on track doing the things I need to do. It works really well, and I love that it lets me pause a routine if work is going really well.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best endorsement I can give it is that even though it does what I need, I am constantly thinking of things I wish it did and ways to improve. Now that I&#8217;ve mentioned that, I guess I&#8217;ll have to schedule some time to send my list over to Daniel&#8230;</p>

<p>Well, time&#8217;s up - back to work!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/xcode.html">XCode 3.0 preview page</a> is a cornucopia of new stuff that I somehow missed all day - until now.</p>

<p>No doubt this is the stuff that everyone at WWDC is talking about. This page represents no less than 3 or 4 really significant changes and some really nice details. Here&#8217;s a hit list that I haven&#8217;t seen in any of the coverage I&#8217;ve been looking at today:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Garbage Collection</strong> in ObjC. I&#8217;m curious about the details, but I&#8217;m also certain that it&#8217;s a good thing. I really just think this is a no-brainer and we&#8217;ll all be asking how we lived without it in a year.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Project Snapshots</strong> - lets you fiddle with projects and go back to a good state without involving SVN. Nice, it&#8217;s like Word Versions for XCode. Handy, but a little puzzling why it seems to be duplicating version control functionality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Research Assistant</strong> - A &#8216;lightweight window&#8217; for reference and API docs. Long overdue, and sounds really handy. Basically what I <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/blog/blosxom.pl/2004/07/07">asked for</a> in a Dashboard Widget long ago.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/content/dtrace/">DTrace</a></strong> for Mac OS - this is an extremely useful and powerful dynamic tracing framework from Sun - with a <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/howtoguides/dtracehowto.jsp#1">DSL for tracing</a> called &#8220;D&#8221;, and I&#8217;m really surprised to see it on OS X. This is nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Leveraging DTrace, <strong>XRay</strong> visualizes program behavior. I think DTrace itself is more interesting, based on my experiences with visualization of parallel program behavior and developers (generally allergic) reaction to it, but it&#8217;s interesting to see Apple give it a serious try. The ability to &#8220;track UI events&#8221; sounds tantalizingly useful.</p></li>
<li><p>A new text editor - apparently it can shade text backgrounds according to scope. This could either be a non-starter or really great. I think some will love it after a while and some will hate it immediately. Which are you? Oh, it also does iChat-style popups on your breakpoints. Okay.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, Interface Builder 3.0, where they spend a lot of time talking about some extra palletized stuff you can drop in, which is all well and good, but then they drop the boom in the last two sentences: <strong><em>&#8220;Interface Builder 3.0 makes localization and diffing easier. And you can include your NIBs in global refactoring tasks.&#8221;</em></strong> Whoa! That sound you just heard? <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/blog/blosxom.pl/2004/07/07">It was me from 2004</a>, cheering them on.</p></li>
</ul>


<p> <strong>Update</strong>: <code>s/XCode/Xcode/</code> - thanks.</p>
