I don't remember, but I must have just shot off the couch. You see, when I caught the power cord of my Powerbook in between my toes, there was enough velocity to pull the laptop halfway across the table. It punted my full coffee mug into the hallway, contents flying everywhere.

The laptop caught some coffee, but avoided the full soaking that the rest of the table got, with the neat trick of being off the table by the time most of the coffee hit.

I'm just really glad that my carpet is brown right now.

Anyone else vote for a [MagSafe](http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/design.html) retrofit accessory? I'd drop $29.95 for sure.
