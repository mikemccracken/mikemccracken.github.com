Dear [Rady School](http://management.ucsd.edu/), you may be dedicated to producing business leaders who can straddle both the business world and the world of science and technology, but please ditch the little animated guy on your homepage who told me that.

Also, please read this adaptive path [essay on user-centered URL design](http://adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000058.php), and revisit your URLs. Most of your URLs look like this: http://management.ucsd.edu/cms/showcontent.aspx?ContentID=163

I care about 30 of those characters, including dots, one slash and protocol. There are another 31 characters that *never change* and don't tell me anything about the page.

For the previous URL (#163), might I suggest: http://management.ucsd.edu/facilities

And for the next number up, #164 (apparently not up yet, but it should be the web syllabus for a class), might I suggest: http://management.ucsd.edu/courses/2006/summer/mgt-111

Thanks,

mike
