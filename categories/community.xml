&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aosabook.org/en/index.html"&gt;The Architecture of Open Source Applications&lt;/a&gt; - Architects look at thousands of buildings during their training, and study critiques of those buildings written by masters. In contrast, most software developers only ever get to know a handful of large programs well--usually programs they wrote themselves--and never study the great programs of history. As a result, they repeat one another's mistakes rather than building on one another's successes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book's goal is to change that. In it, the authors of twenty-five open source applications explain how their software is structured, and why. What are each program's major components? How do they interact? And what did their builders learn during their development? In answering these questions, the contributors to this book provide unique insights into how they think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a junior developer, and want to learn how your more experienced colleagues think, this book is the place to start. If you are an intermediate or senior developer, and want to see how your peers have solved hard design problems, this book can help you too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.neverworkintheory.org/?p=197"&gt;An Empirical Comparison of the Accuracy Rates of Novices using the Quorum, Perl, and Randomo Programming Languages - It will never work in theory&lt;/a&gt; - We present here an empirical study comparing the accuracy rates of novices writing software in three programming languages: Quorum, Perl, and Randomo. The first language, Quorum, we call an evidence-based programming language, where the syntax, semantics, and API designs change in correspondence to the latest academic research and literature on programming language usability. Second, while Perl is well known, we call Randomo a Placebo-language, where some of the syntax was chosen with a random number generator and the ASCII table. We compared novices that were programming for the first time using each of these languages, testing how accurately they could write simple programs using common program constructs (e.g., loops, conditionals, functions, variables, parameters). Results showed that while Quorum users were afforded significantly greater accuracy compared to those using Perl and Randomo, Perl users were unable to write programs more accurately than those using a language designed by chance&lt;/li&gt;

I haven't written cocoa code in a long time, so I'm not really clear on how often this would apply. I thought there were a lot of places where the API just uses raw ints already?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone could nominate an app, and the developer community would vote on who wins, in just a few categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking the categories could be a little more user-centric than Apple's. For instance, I don't really care about best adoption of OS X technologies, but something like "best refinement of a common task" or "best default behavior" or "best scriptability" would be interesting, and something that'd be easier to use as a marketing badge...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just off the top of my head, so there are probably others. "Least data lock-in"? "Easiest to learn?", "Best plugin community"?&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>apps</category><category>awards</category><category>community</category><category>mac</category><guid>http://michael-mccracken.net/2009/10/id-like-to-see-a-community-run-version/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Oct 2009 19:08:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
