My shared links for February 27th through March 1st:






  * [Pretty Lisp | Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3649518) I don't like this. Great comment thread though - lots of people agree with me. I think maybe enthusiasm for structure editors is a sign of youthful optimism and inexperience.


  * [2004 Rob Pike Q&A Interview - Slashdot](http://interviews.slashdot.org/story/04/10/18/1153211/rob-pike-responds) - "(And speaking of Doug, he's the unsung hero of Unix. He was manager of the group that produced it and a huge creative force in the group, but he's almost unknown in the Unix community. He invented a couple of things you might have heard of: pipes and - get this - macros. Well, someone had to do it and that someone was Doug. As Ken once said when we were talking one day in the Unix room, "There's no one smarter than Doug.")

  * [How To Build a Naive Bayes Classifier | Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3638045) - Useful comment thread about building naive bayes classifiers


  * [A Legal Issues Primer for Open Source and Free Software Projects - Software Freedom Law Center](http://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2008/foss-primer.html#x1-130002.5) -
