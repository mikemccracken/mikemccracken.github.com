In relation to my previous post about [instant replay in QuickTime Player](http://michael-mccracken.net/wp/?p=55) - The script dictionary almost looks like a program wrote the documentation. For example:

"**time scale** (integer, r/o) : the time scale of the movie" (uh...) and


"**current time** (integer) : the current time (can be set by name as well as number)" (units? what names?).

I guess it all makes sense if you understand a lot about QuickTime movies, but is that the audience for the script dictionary? I suggest not.

Developers: your script dictionary and its documentation are important user interface concerns - if you put as much consideration into the experience your users have with scripting as you do the GUI and documentation, it will create loyal power users. And they all have blogs these days, so that's free advertising too...
