&lt;p&gt;Jesper at &lt;a href="http://waffle.wootest.net"&gt;waffle&lt;/a&gt; is starting an open-source web browser project to revive the spirit of OmniWeb, called &lt;a href="http://waffle.wootest.net/2010/04/18/rouse-involvement/"&gt;rouse&lt;/a&gt;. He coins the phrase "delight innovation". I love that phrase. He's talking about taking a browser, something that's relatively stable, and looking for ways to make it noticeably better again. I love that impulse - it's something I'm hoping to see in email clients too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another place that delight showed up (along with Surprise and Joy), was at &lt;a href="http://52weeksofux.com"&gt;52 weeks of UX&lt;/a&gt; in a post called &lt;a href="http://52weeksofux.com/post/531355592/design-for-delight"&gt;"design for delight"&lt;/a&gt;. That post  seemed to be a little more about the parts of design that don't affect functionality, but do add personality. I really agree with this angle too - I like a program that has little details that are &lt;a href="http://borkware.com/quickies/single?id=319"&gt;just for fun&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</description><category>computers</category><category>delight</category><category>design</category><category>innovation</category><guid>http://michael-mccracken.net/posts/2010/04/delight-innovation.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2010 17:48:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
