&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pixelatedimage.com/blog/2011/07/45-days/"&gt;45 Days.&lt;/a&gt; - "fill the days with little things first and there won't be room for the big ones"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An hour a day = 45 days a year. The kind of thing you just need to keep re-hearing every so often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So all these years later I'm trying to make a very odd movie indeed, about computer chess programmers circa 1980, and perhaps deep down it's my attempt to vicariously peek into the fantasy braniac life I ought to have pursued as a kid. It happens to be a fascinating era for the field. As computers were exploding into the public sphere, and regular folks were just getting used to seeing them in the workplace, or home, a group of geniuses at the vanguard of the technology were trying to teach it what seemed like an almost unimaginable skill--could these machines, these glorified calculators, ever conquer the human world champion in chess? Obviously a human being would have to be a genius to be the world chess champ, so if they could get a computer to do it, the computer would have to acquire a kind of genius, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
