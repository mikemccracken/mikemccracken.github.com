My shared links for September 4th through September 6th:






  * [VIDEO ESSAY: CHAOS CINEMA: The decline and fall of action filmmaking > Press Play](http://blogs.indiewire.com/pressplay/archives/video_essay_matthias_stork_calls_out_the_chaos_cinema/) - A great essay, essentially anti-shakycam and fastcuts. Nice to see the example of Ronin for a slow-cut, well set up sequence.


  * [LilyPond - Music notation for everyone: Examples](http://lilypond.org/examples.html) - music notation markup
