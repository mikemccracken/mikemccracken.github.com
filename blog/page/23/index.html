  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t remember, but I must have just shot off the couch. You see, when I caught the power cord of my Powerbook in between my toes, there was enough velocity to pull the laptop halfway across the table. It punted my full coffee mug into the hallway, contents flying everywhere.</p>

<p>The laptop caught some coffee, but avoided the full soaking that the rest of the table got, with the neat trick of being off the table by the time most of the coffee hit.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m just really glad that my carpet is brown right now.</p>

<p>Anyone else vote for a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/design.html">MagSafe</a> retrofit accessory? I&#8217;d drop $29.95 for sure.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.gotw.ca/">Herb Sutter</a>, software architect at Microsoft, chair of the ISO C/C++ committee, and <a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/hsutter/">blogger</a>, gave a talk this Monday about the impending concurrency revolution and his project, Concur, an extension to C style languages to support usable concurrent programming. I enjoyed his talk in spite of the job-fair atmosphere (it was also a Microsoft recruiting event) and having to stand the whole time, so I&#8217;d say it was a good talk.</p>

<p>Check out his article <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm">&#8220;The Free Lunch is Over&#8221;</a> for a programmer&#8217;s viewpoint on what to do with the processors we&#8217;re currently faced with. This is a very exciting time for computing - parallelism has always been the future, and the future is finally now. I am increasingly convinced that as a programmer, if you resist learning how to program concurrent systems, then you will be obsolete very, very soon.</p>

<p>The reason is that processor architects have density to waste, but they have nearly run out of ways to use extra transistors to make single processors faster - so they&#8217;re happily just shipping chips with bunches of smaller processors. According to intel&#8217;s (nicely readable) <a href="http://www.intel.com/technology/architecture/platform2015/">Platform 2015</a> site, Dual and Quad-core isn&#8217;t nearly the end - today&#8217;s college freshman will likely start out their career programming not &#8220;multi-&#8220;, but &#8220;many-core&#8221; systems (think &#8216;at least hundreds&#8217;), requiring hundreds or thousands of independent threads of execution to avoid leaving performance on the table. Are we preparing students for this? I doubt it.</p>

<p>So, should we all run off and learn all about pthreads and mutexes? No - concurrent programming is really hard, even to get it almost right on a toy problem. In some areas (like servers and mathematics used for scientific computing), concurrency is a &#8220;well-understood&#8221; problem, but even there it&#8217;s widely understood to be hard. No wonder everybody&#8217;s been avoiding it.</p>

<p>This is really a problem for language designers, framework designers, and compiler writers - how do we build an environment where a reasonably competent developer can write and debug programs with a very high level of concurrency? For everyone else, just keep your eyes peeled - <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/jv/events/TRANSACT/">they&#8217;re working on it</a>.</p>

<p>To quote Maurice Herlihy, from an invited speech (<a href="http://research.ihost.com/pldi2005/manifesto.pldi.ppt">ppt slides</a>) at 2005&#8217;s <a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/pldi.htm">PLDI</a> conference (for compiler writers and language jockeys), This situation amounts to a &#8220;PLDI Full-employment act&#8221;. Interesting times, indeed!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A quick thought: why not wrap NSUndoManager to support adding scriptable hooks to almost any user action? Surely someone can think of a good scheme to let an application programmer support really thorough scriptability without tons of extra work&#8230;</p>

<p>I thought of this because I&#8217;d like a way to mark a To-do item for an email reply as completed once I&#8217;d sent the email, and a good way would be with an email-send hook in Apple Mail.</p>

<p>Okay that&#8217;s it, thanks!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After reading Merlin Mann&#8217;s <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/02/27/contexts/">suggestion to live in iCal</a>, I thought that even though I don&#8217;t use <a href="http://www.kinkless.com/">kGTD</a>, it might be a good idea to try to limit the number of places where things I have to do exist. Following on the idea of moving lines of text from <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/wp/?p=28">VoodooPad to iCal todos</a>, I just wrote a script to take the frontmost email message and add a todo that reminds me to reply to it. I&#8217;m getting a little closer to just having one place I need to check tasks.</p>

<pre><code>tell application "Mail"
    set l to the selection as list
    set selMesg to item 1 of l
    set cont to content of selMesg as string
    set subj to subject of selMesg as string
    set person to sender of selMesg as string
    tell application "iCal"
        set theCal to (first calendar whose title is "Email")
        set theString to "reply to " &amp; person &amp; " about " &amp; subj
        make todo at end of todos of theCal with properties {priority:0, summary:theString}
    end tell
end tell
</code></pre>

<p>This ends up with a todo that says something like <strong>&#8220;reply to michael_mccracken@mac.com about Locations for the party of the century&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>Of course, it&#8217;s best invoked with a twitch and <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com">Quicksilver</a>, so just drop it in <code>~/Library/Scripts</code> so it gets indexed. I called it &#8220;NewTodoFromEmail&#8221; and Quicksilver calls it &#8220;nte&#8221;. Clever.</p>

<p>I based it on my <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/blog/blosxom.pl/computers/mac/programming/ASiCal.html">NewEventFromEmail script</a>, which I still use regularly. So nice!</p>

I live in San Diego - but I can&#8217;t even afford the deeply discounted student admissions. I&#8217;d go to see the <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2006/view/e_sess/8292">microformats session</a>, since I&#8217;m interested in seeing a good <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/citation">citation microformat</a> develop.</p>

<p>If anyone I know or should know is in town for the conference and wants to hang out, I know a few good places to go - <a href="mailto:michael_mccracken@mac.com">email me</a> or something.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I take notes at meetings in VoodooPad, and as such I write a lot of to-do items in MeetingNotes pages. They tend to get buried in those pages unless I do something about it fast. Sometimes I put them somewhere more useful, like on my &#8220;TodoToday&#8221; page, but that page is getting more like a &#8220;TodoSomeday&#8221; page, and isn&#8217;t fit for serious action items. Today I realized that I wanted a script to take line-items from VoodooPad pages and make them into Todo items in iCal, so I can track them easier.</p>

<p>I already have a <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/blog/blosxom.pl/computers/mac/todoQuickSilver.html">Quicksilver plugin for creating new todos</a>, so I repurposed it as a python plugin for VoodooPad to add a big list all at once. Check out <a href="http://www.gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2006/1/21.html">Gus&#8217; post on python plugins</a> for the enabler, and then check this sucker out:</p>

<pre><code>VPScriptSuperMenuTitle = "Notes"
VPScriptMenuTitle = 'Create Todos in iCal'

import os

def main(windowController, *args, **kwargs):
    tv = windowController.textView()
    s = tv.string()
    ranges = tv.selectedRanges()

    scriptString = ""
    for r in ranges:
        rs = s.substringWithRange_(r.rangeValue())

        lines = rs.split("\n")
        for line in lines:
            if len(line) &lt; 1: continue
            scriptString += "tell application \"iCal\"\n\
            set theCal to (first calendar whose title is \"Work\")\n\
            make todo at end of todos of theCal with properties\
            {priority:0, summary:\"%s\"}\n\
            end tell\n" % line

    f = os.popen("/usr/bin/osascript", 'w')
    f.write(scriptString)
    f.close()
</code></pre>

<p>Want to add to it? These and many things are easily imaginable:</p>

<ul>
<li>Change priority based on the first character of each line</li>
<li>handle continuation lines better</li>
<li>change calendar to select based on some simple syntax, like &#8221;<em> foo&#8221; is a line with text &#8220;foo&#8221; but &#8221;</em>foo bar&#8221; is a line with text &#8220;bar&#8221; destined for calendar &#8220;foo&#8221;&#8230;</li>
<li>Another idea: a line starting with the words &#8220;email&#8221; or &#8220;mail&#8221; be made into a todo with the glyph ✉, and/or an actual email in Mail.app.</li>
<li>Any other ideas?</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now that we&#8217;ve got Google Maps, I&#8217;d like to see my calendar program (iCal) extended to pay more attention to the location of events. Show me how long it&#8217;ll take to get to events I&#8217;ve scheduled, based on where they are. Traffic estimates would make this really killer (at least here in So-Cal)</p>

<p>It might sound like you would need to tell the app where you will be at every point of the day for this to work, but you could avoid that by storing a &#8216;coming from&#8217; location for each event - it <em>could</em> be the previous event, but you could also just pick it from a list of default places, like &#8216;Home&#8217;, &#8216;Work&#8217;, and &#8216;Hockey Rink&#8217;.</p>

<p>In my dream world, they&#8217;d look like error bars on a plot, they&#8217;d even have data about variability of the traffic estimates, and they&#8217;d be in the next version of iCal.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a quick visual, in case I didn&#8217;t describe it well enough:</p>

<p><img src="http://michael-mccracken.net/img/traveltime-mockup.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Assume home is south of the office and the basketball court is north. Traffic is bad going north around 6. What it&#8217;s telling you now is you can go home fast, and have 30 minutes there before you have to leave again, go straight to the court, taking 45 minutes in traffic and getting there 45 minutes early, or have about an hour at the office, wait out traffic, and get to the court on time in about 25 minutes.</p>

<p>Update: I changed the example to be a little clearer - I added an option to show traffic choices, showed the times by the routes, and made one event appear selected, since you probably only want this extra info for the selected event.</p>

<p>I also made it a basketball game because everyone knows you&#8217;d need to go home to get your gear if you were going to the rink anyway. Seriously.</p>

<blockquote><p>SUBJECT: Google Desktop Security Exposure</p>

<p>Google Desktop V.3 contains certain features that raise serious security
and privacy concerns. Specifically, the &#8220;share across computers&#8221; feature
that introduces the ability to search content from desktop to desktop
greatly increases the risk to users&#8217; privacy. If Google Desktop V.3 is
set to allow &#8220;Search Across Computers&#8221; files on an indexed computer are
copied to Google&#8217;s servers. We recommend that individuals seriously
consider the potential for information stored on their computers to be
accessed by others if they enable this feature of Google Desktop V. 3 on
their computers.</p>

<p>Employees of the University (whether student, regular staff or faculty)
who have confidential data on their work or home computers should not
enable this feature. There are both privacy laws and university policies
that could be violated through the installation of this feature,
specifically, SB 1386, HIPPA, FERPA and GLBA.</p>

<p>While some of the features of Google Desktop V.3 are enticing to
faculty, students, and staff, it is important to understand how
information is collected, stored, and shared through this application,
and the potential privacy risk to individuals.</p>
