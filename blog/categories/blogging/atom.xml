    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My last wordpress upgrade was a long time ago, and it's going to stay that way.</p>

<p>These posts about blogging are really only interesting years later,
and only to me, when I look back and think about what I was doing that
I thought I had time to mess with blogging software.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/2005/12/25/test-wordpress/">Last time</a> I made a major change was switching to wordpress from
blosxom back in December 2005, over Christmas break. I was at my
parents' house and had nothing to do after everyone went to bed at 9pm.</p>

<p>These days I can't remember the feeling of having nothing to do, but I
went ahead and switched things up anyway, exactly because I don't have
time to mess with things like upgrading wordpress.</p>

<p>So I'm going with octopress on github user pages. I like generating a
static site from text files, and github pages are sort of convenient. (sort of)</p>
