    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="http://design.canonical.com/2011/05/ivanka-quo-vadis/">post describing her departure from Canonical</a>, designer Ivanka Majic wrote this evocative description of what it's like working on a high-profile open source project:</p>

<blockquote><p>Imagine walking into a room where a few hundred people are talking to you at the same time. You can’t hear, you don’t know where to start, the noise is overwhelming and you are just about to put your hands over your ears and scream when you notice someone catch your eye and smile; you notice another person pick up something you have dropped and put it where you can see it, a cup of tea appears in your hand and someone else starts quietly answering one person, then another. The desire to scream will come again, but the support is invaluable. What starts as a feeling that everyone is telling you what to do evolves into the sure knowledge that there are people who will help you catch a dropped ball.</p></blockquote>
