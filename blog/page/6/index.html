         | <a href="/2011/07/voodoopad-omnifocus-and-terminal-integration-wish-list/#disqus_thread">Comments</a>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here are some features I want but I&#8217;ll never have time to write the scripts for VoodooPad to do.</p>

<p>I use VP mostly as a running log of notes, shell commands and todos. I also use OmniFocus for task tracking, but sometimes it&#8217;s easier to just start typing in VP and work out the tasks later. So I often end up with VP pages that have a bunch of todos mixed in with project headers and miscellaneous notes.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking some integration would be nice. I want an <del><a href="http://orgmode.org/">emacs org-mode</a></del> (update: I meant <a href="http://www.isi.edu/~johnh/SOFTWARE/NOTES_MODE/">notes-mode</a>) style &#8220;new day&#8221; script that creates a new page for the day and does the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>adds a link to the new page to the previous note page</li>
<li>moves any pending todos (I mark them as lines starting with a &lt;# todo #> placeholder so I can jump to them) off yesterday&#8217;s page and into OmniFocus</li>
<li>starts a new header (line starting with #, in bold) in the new page for every header that had leftover todos. These headers usually correspond to projects in OmniFocus.</li>
<li>adds new headers and todo lines for any tasks that are due today</li>
</ul>


<p>I want to have VP autocomplete project names from OmniFocus when I start a header line. Then add a link next to the new header pointing to the last page containing that header.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d also like to have OmniFocus update the VP document when I check off a task in OF - I want to use VP as a log, so I can track down when I did something. Maybe projects should all have their own VP pages, that are kind of an auto-updated index of progress on the tasks.</p>

<p>It&#8217;d also be nice if when I edited a todo line in VP, it could update OF. I guess I want VP to be an supplemental synchronized view onto my OF tasks.</p>

<p>For the Terminal: I do a lot of copying and pasting shell commands into VP so I can remember things like important paths, or the exact configure settings I used to build something two years ago. This is really useful, but it&#8217;d be nice if it was easier to do without leaving the terminal. Ideally I could just prefix a command with something like &#8216;@&#8217; to add it to the current page in VP (or &#8216;@pagename#headername&#8217; to get fancy). You could get this with a script named &#8216;@&#8217; - on your local machine. But it also has to work when you&#8217;re working remotely, so it will get a little more complicated.</p>

<p>Finally - this is something I wanted to try doing with an InputManager before that mechanism went away: I&#8217;d like CamelCase links in every text field on the system (probably with some exceptions) to automatically link to VP pages. But it sounds like the days of modifying system-wide behavior on Macs are history, so I&#8217;ll probably never get this. Who knows, maybe it would&#8217;ve been a disaster.</p>

<p>I always thought the path to improvement in work computing was more and deeper integration between 3rd-party apps, as well as more system functionality that&#8217;s usable by all those apps, but it looks to me* like in OS X we&#8217;re only getting the latter.</p>

<p><em>* - since 10.7 is about to come out, it might be worth pointing out that I have no special advance developer info. I haven&#8217;t even been a dev program member for a few years now.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week, Chuq van Rospach had a tear of great posts about email and online communication in general. I already linked to his first two, about the value (and certain doom) of an email charter <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/2011/06/email-charters-lists-as-parties/">here</a>.
He then went on to discuss what he&#8217;s learned about how to manage email without first trying to change other people&#8217;s behavior, in two parts titled &#8220;Avoiding email bankruptcy&#8221; <a href="http://www.chuqui.com/2011/06/avoiding-email-bankruptcy-part-1/">Part 1</a> and <a href="http://www.chuqui.com/2011/06/avoiding-email-bankruptcy-part-2/">Part 2</a>. Both are well worth a full read, but I&#8217;ll also summarize a bit here.</p>

<p>His <a href="http://www.chuqui.com/2011/06/avoiding-email-bankruptcy-part-1/">Part 1</a> says in effect &#8220;email takes real time, so budget that time.&#8221; His points about never catching up if you try to just fit it in during an otherwise busy day ring especially true. I&#8217;d add that any reputation benefit you get from fast turnaround is lost by being that guy who is checking email during meetings.</p>

<p>His <a href="http://www.chuqui.com/2011/06/avoiding-email-bankruptcy-part-2/">Part 2</a> goes into detail on his email workflow. I was pleased to see that my own workflow is similar - I don&#8217;t get nearly as much mail as he does (sending 225 and reading 400 messages a day? Ouch), so it&#8217;s nice to see that my approach could scale.</p>

<p>The high points we have in common are</p>

<ul>
<li>Separate work and home email accounts. <em>Very important</em>. I couldn&#8217;t agree more, and people who want unified inboxes in a mail client baffle me.</li>
<li>try to decide what to do with an email the first time you read it, then archive it right away</li>
<li>no filing, just one big Archive.</li>
<li>filter lists out of the inbox ( I only do this for high-traffic lists, but my idea of &#8220;high&#8221; is not that high. )</li>
<li>simple filtering - I don&#8217;t try to use filters to pick out &#8220;important&#8221; emails - my goal is to read every mail. If I can&#8217;t, I need to reduce the incoming flow, not tweak my mail client setup.</li>
</ul>


<p>One difference is that he says he uses his inbox as a to-do list, where I prefer to move things to OmniFocus as soon as I understand what the task is. But it&#8217;s possible we&#8217;re just calling the same thing by different names.</p>

<p>He also does more manual management of his archive folder than I do - but maybe this is because there are less than 10,000 emails in there right now. I imagine his archives are bigger. Mail.app doesn&#8217;t have much trouble with mine.</p>

<p>Also my archive is a local folder - so it never has to sync with IMAP. This is due to a server mailbox size limit, and it&#8217;s not ideal. It&#8217;d be nice if I could see my archive on my phone, but hey, it&#8217;s only 2011.</p>
