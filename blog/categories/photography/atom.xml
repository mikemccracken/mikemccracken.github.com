    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last night I took my camera with me on a late-night food run. On the way back, I stopped at the end of Felspar street and took some shots of the beach scene. My favorite two are already up at Flickr, but I thought I&rsquo;d expand on them a bit here.</p>

<p>This is the end of Crystal Pier, which houses a hotel (you can see the last of the cabins on the left). I took a bunch of these shots, playing with the sensitivity and exposure. This was the longest &ndash; at ISO 200 and f/4.0, exposed for about 10 seconds.</p>

<p>Even with an f/1.4 lens, it was super dark and I had to focus manually. I set the camera on a post and used a 2-second delayed shutter to keep it still and out of my shaky hands.</p>

<p>For comparison, here&rsquo;s a version taken at ISO 1600 :</p>

<p>Even reduced in size, you can really notice the noise.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a shot of a cleaning lady working at JRDN, the swank bar in the new Tower 23 hotel. Tower 23 doesn&rsquo;t really fit in in PB &ndash; it&rsquo;s way too self-conscious and preening of a place to feel natural in such a laid-back, seedy beach neighborhood. It seemed appropriate that on a Sunday night when the more relaxed established places like the PB Bar &amp; Grill and Longboards were really hopping, JRDN was closed &ndash; looking its ghostly best.</p>

<p>I should have remembered that I&rsquo;d set the 2-second delay before I took this shot &ndash; I had the woman framed well, hit the shutter and wondered what was going on. Luckily, she stayed in the door frame, but I could swear it was a better shot just two seconds before.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another missed shot opportunity, as she ducks behind the bar just as I find the right exposure and focus. I think the color in the other one makes it better, but the angle of the bar on this one has some promise. Shot through a couple of layers of glass, and manual focus &ndash; I&rsquo;m sure it could be sharper if I&rsquo;d kept trying.</p>

<p><a href="http://weblog.scifihifi.com/">Buzz Andersen</a> was in town for the 4th of July, and we both took a few photos, up on Flickr: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/ldandersen/tags/sandiego/">Buzz&rsquo;s San Diego Photos</a>, and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/michaelmccracken/tags/buzz/">my photos of Buzz</a>.</p>

<p>When I get the film back from the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/michaelmccracken/tags/yashica/">Yashica</a>, I&rsquo;ll scan some more photos in.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I&rsquo;ve been getting more into photography, so if you want the full MMC web experience, you could subscribe to a <a href="http://flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?id=51035756035@N01&amp;format;=rss_200">feed of my photos</a>, which should already be part of my <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Michael-mccrackennet">feedburner feed</a>. And if you&rsquo;re a fellow Flickr photo nut, feel free to add me as a contact and tell me when I reach  photo genius.</p>

<p>PS, I&rsquo;ve been working with the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/lightroom/">Adobe Lightroom beta</a> to process my pictures lately. I really like the focus on workflow, and the UI is very responsive on my old PowerBook G4. It does get a little slower when dealing with 6MP RAW photos, but almost never beachballs. Furthermore, single key shortcuts are priceless for a program aimed at serious users.</p>
