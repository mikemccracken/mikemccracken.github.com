Just went to see Jorge Cham's talk ["The Power of Procrastination"](http://www.phdcomics.com/speaking.htm) about grad school.
There were plenty of good grad-school jokes and a general feeling of relief that comes with being in a big room full of people who laugh at the same old chestnuts about how nobody ever really feels like they fit in and always feel guilty about whatever it is you spend your free time doing - you know, when you *should* be doing research!

If you get a chance to see his talk, go for it, even if you've read all the comics, it'll make you feel better. And if you haven't seen the comics, go [read them all first](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/comics.php), then see the talk. Now I'm going to get back to work.
