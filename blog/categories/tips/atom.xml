    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here are some features I want but I'll never have time to write the scripts for VoodooPad to do.</p>

<p>I use VP mostly as a running log of notes, shell commands and todos. I also use OmniFocus for task tracking, but sometimes it's easier to just start typing in VP and work out the tasks later. So I often end up with VP pages that have a bunch of todos mixed in with project headers and miscellaneous notes.</p>

<p>I've been thinking some integration would be nice. I want an <del><a href="http://orgmode.org/">emacs org-mode</a></del> (update: I meant <a href="http://www.isi.edu/~johnh/SOFTWARE/NOTES_MODE/">notes-mode</a>) style "new day" script that creates a new page for the day and does the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>adds a link to the new page to the previous note page</li>
<li>moves any pending todos (I mark them as lines starting with a &lt;# todo #> placeholder so I can jump to them) off yesterday's page and into OmniFocus</li>
<li>starts a new header (line starting with #, in bold) in the new page for every header that had leftover todos. These headers usually correspond to projects in OmniFocus.</li>
<li>adds new headers and todo lines for any tasks that are due today</li>
</ul>


<p>I want to have VP autocomplete project names from OmniFocus when I start a header line. Then add a link next to the new header pointing to the last page containing that header.</p>

<p>I'd also like to have OmniFocus update the VP document when I check off a task in OF - I want to use VP as a log, so I can track down when I did something. Maybe projects should all have their own VP pages, that are kind of an auto-updated index of progress on the tasks.</p>

<p>It'd also be nice if when I edited a todo line in VP, it could update OF. I guess I want VP to be an supplemental synchronized view onto my OF tasks.</p>

<p>For the Terminal: I do a lot of copying and pasting shell commands into VP so I can remember things like important paths, or the exact configure settings I used to build something two years ago. This is really useful, but it'd be nice if it was easier to do without leaving the terminal. Ideally I could just prefix a command with something like '@' to add it to the current page in VP (or '@pagename#headername' to get fancy). You could get this with a script named '@' - on your local machine. But it also has to work when you're working remotely, so it will get a little more complicated.</p>

<p>Finally - this is something I wanted to try doing with an InputManager before that mechanism went away: I'd like CamelCase links in every text field on the system (probably with some exceptions) to automatically link to VP pages. But it sounds like the days of modifying system-wide behavior on Macs are history, so I'll probably never get this. Who knows, maybe it would've been a disaster.</p>

<p>I always thought the path to improvement in work computing was more and deeper integration between 3rd-party apps, as well as more system functionality that's usable by all those apps, but it looks to me* like in OS X we're only getting the latter.</p>

<p><em>* - since 10.7 is about to come out, it might be worth pointing out that I have no special advance developer info. I haven't even been a dev program member for a few years now.</em></p>

    <id>http://michael-mccracken.net/2007/03/a-script-for-text-placeholders-in-voodoopad</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year I wrote about my <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/wp/?p=39">new page template for VoodooPad</a>. I still use something like it - I like the uniform look and the built-in navigation starters I get in every page.</p>

<p>I got tired of all the clicking around it took to fill in the navigation every time I put in a new page, so I decided to write a script to mimic XCode's "Select Next Placeholder" command. In XCode, if you use code completion, you might get something like this:
<code>[dict setObject:&lt;# (id) anObject #&gt; forKey:&lt;# (id)key #&gt;]</code> Then pressing Control-/ cycles the selection through those placeholders so you can replace them with whatever you want quickly.</p>

<p>That's really handy for code, and it's great for VoodooPad templates too. I wrote the script as a Python script plugin for VoodooPad, and it maps Command-/ to select the next placeholder, wrapping the search at the end just like XCode does. Now my new page template in VoodooPad has a few placeholders in it, and I have a lot fewer pages with default template text sitting in there making me look lazy.</p>

<p>Download it <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/2007/Select-Next-Placeholder.py">here</a>. (Note, it needs the <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/fs/flystashweb.cgi/40de692c-e33c-01d9-12a1-c0cbe4c4d9e7">VoodooPad Python Plugin Enabler</a> )</p>

    <link href="http://michael-mccracken.net/2007/02/linking-the-os-x-clipboard-and-xterms-selection/"/>
    <updated>2007-02-19T10:23:22-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://michael-mccracken.net/2007/02/linking-the-os-x-clipboard-and-xterms-selection</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you only use X11 for XTerm, it might seem like the handling of the clipboard in Apple's X11.app is broken. You can select text and paste it with a click of the middle mouse button (opt-click on my Powerbook), and that works when pasting into other X apps, but it doesn't change the Mac clipboard at all.</p>

<p>Why not? Is X11.app just ignoring the X clipboard?</p>

<p>No - X11.app <em>does</em> synchronize the two clipboards. The problem is that the selection pasting in XTerm is using a completely different buffer. There's a full and clear explanation, with some interesting details about (X)Emacs' behavior, at <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/x-cut-and-paste.html">jwz.org</a>.</p>

<p>If, like me, you only use X11 for Emacs and XTerm, you might want to link the selection in XTerm to the X clipboard, so X11.app will then sync that with the system clipboard and you can select in XTerm and paste with Cmd-V in say, Mail.app.</p>

<p>I'll tell you how in a sec, but first the caveat - I said if you only use X11 for Emacs and XTerm because what we're going to do is make setting the XTerm selection always overwrite the clipboard contents. If you use X apps that use the X clipboard, sometimes you don't want that. So beware. If you use Emacs, it just pushes onto the kill ring, so you're good.</p>

<p>OK, now that that's over, add these lines to your ~/.Xdefaults:</p>

<pre><code>XTerm*VT100.Translations: #override\
&lt;BtnUp&gt;: select-end(CLIPBOARD,PRIMARY)\n\
&lt;Btn2Down&gt;: insert-selection(PRIMARY)\n\
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the backslashes at the end of the lines are important.</p>

<p>Update: The first version of this post didn't include the Btn2Down action. Without that, the original paste behavior goes away - the man page doesn't really explain the "#override" keyword, so I'm not sure why.</p>
