My shared links for July 19th through July 22nd:






  * [Artificial Intelligence Applications | Securities Trading | Nerds on Wall Street | Computational Finance](http://nerdsonwallstreet.com/artificial-intelligence-and-wall-street-trading-309/) - 

 
  * [Making Desktop Webapps in Lion - Andy Ihnatko's Celestial Waste of Bandwidth (BETA)](http://ihnatko.com/2011/07/22/making-desktop-webapps-in-lion/) - Site-specific browsing gets OS support. Just in time for the inspiration for my webmail.app (GMail) to get permanently tagged with a social network's notification wart.


  * [Objectivist-C - Tagged pointers and fast-pathed CFNumber integers in Lion](http://objectivistc.tumblr.com/post/7872364181/tagged-pointers-and-fast-pathed-cfnumber-integers-in) - Neat little trick to reduce the impact of boxing/unboxing. I haven't written cocoa code in a long time, so I'm not really clear on how often this would apply. I thought there were a lot of places where the API just uses raw ints already?


  * [Put This On â€¢ We Got It for Free: Randolph Engineering I've...](http://putthison.com/post/6286554010/we-got-it-for-free-randolph-engineering-ive) - I need new sunglasses, and I'm too old for plastic surfer shades. Wear those to a business lunch and you look like a chump. But aviators can make you look like some kind of fratbro, so what to do? I turn to Put This On.


  * [If your website's full of assholes, it's your fault - Anil Dash](http://dashes.com/anil/2011/07/if-your-websites-full-of-assholes-its-your-fault.html) - A great post about applying what we've learned over human history to make communities work, to the web.

After all, the web is just people.


  * [Buxton collection](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/bibuxton/buxtoncollection/) - a gallery of technology design
