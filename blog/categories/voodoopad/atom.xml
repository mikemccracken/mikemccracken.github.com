    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Alex Payne&rsquo;s recent post <a href="http://al3x.net/2009/01/31/against-everything-buckets.html">The case against everything buckets</a> makes a strong point in favor of using the filesystem for filing. To paraphrase: If your problem is that you have a bunch of files you need to search through, and possibly tag, then the filesystem and Spotlight are probably closer to solving your problem than you expect.</p>

<p>I enjoyed reading his post, because I like rules of thumb for simple design, and one of my favorites is &ldquo;why not just use files?&rdquo; &ndash; there are often reasons to do something else, but the filesystem is faster, more reliable, and more open than anything you&rsquo;re likely to come up with on the first try. So you&rsquo;d better be sure you&rsquo;re not just poorly reimplementing it.</p>

<p>Buzz Andersen has a <a href="http://log.scifihifi.com/post/76989703/everything-buckets">thorough response</a>, centering on the fact that VoodooPad is a very useful app. Certainly I agree &ndash; I use it all the time, and its hyperlinking sets it apart from other notes apps (and the filesystem). So yes, VoodooPad is a Good Idea.</p>

<p>But is VoodooPad really an &ldquo;Everything Bucket&rdquo;? I&rsquo;m not sold &ndash; you can use it to store PDFs and images and other files, but it really focuses on pages, and those files are just attachments to your pages. I see it as a notes app. I think if your problem is keeping notes &ndash; with images if necessary, linking between them, and searching those notes, then VoodooPad is clearly better than the filesystem. But you don&rsquo;t have to put everything else in there too.</p>

<p>I agree with Alex that I don&rsquo;t want one program to keep everything in a proprietary database. I like apps that keep my files as files. (like <a href="http://c-command.com/eaglefiler/">EagleFiler</a>.) But I do want layers on top of the filesystem &ndash; you wouldn&rsquo;t want to use just files for email, for example.</p>

<p>The only solution that&rsquo;s always bad is the solution to someone else&rsquo;s problem.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From Flying Meat, <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad">VoodooPad</a> 3.5 is out.
(<a href="http://www.flyingmeat.com/fs/flystashweb.cgi/2dc35f78-ac3e-01dc-01d4-c0cbe4c4bd91">release notes here</a>).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a solid update, including welcome image-editor integration and more. I thought I&rsquo;d point out my favorite feature in the release notes:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can now edit pages and sort the results in the search window (woo!).&rdquo;</p>

<p>I like this because it matches a kind of manual refactoring habit I picked up with Project Builder / XCode&rsquo;s excellent &ldquo;Find in Project…&rdquo; window &ndash; I search for a keyword that marks places I need to look at and edit the files right in the search window. (Note: <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Other-Repeating-Search.html">&lsquo;occur-mode&rsquo; and kin</a> are a powerful way to do the same in Emacs…)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a powerful habit if you plan for it, by using comments in code to keep track of what you&rsquo;ve touched when making a lot of cross-cutting changes, like <code># @addsearch</code> Then when you think you&rsquo;re done with a change, you can run a quick search to see if you forgot to fix anything.</p>

<p>Sometimes in VoodooPad notes, I&rsquo;ll write in placeholders like that comment when I don&rsquo;t have a bit of information yet, and now I can follow my trails the same way I do in code.</p>

<p>Thanks, Gus!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year I wrote about my <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/wp/?p=39">new page template for VoodooPad</a>. I still use something like it &ndash; I like the uniform look and the built-in navigation starters I get in every page.</p>

<p>I got tired of all the clicking around it took to fill in the navigation every time I put in a new page, so I decided to write a script to mimic XCode&rsquo;s &ldquo;Select Next Placeholder&rdquo; command. In XCode, if you use code completion, you might get something like this:
<code>[dict setObject:&lt;# (id) anObject #&gt; forKey:&lt;# (id)key #&gt;]</code> Then pressing Control-/ cycles the selection through those placeholders so you can replace them with whatever you want quickly.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s really handy for code, and it&rsquo;s great for VoodooPad templates too. I wrote the script as a Python script plugin for VoodooPad, and it maps Command-/ to select the next placeholder, wrapping the search at the end just like XCode does. Now my new page template in VoodooPad has a few placeholders in it, and I have a lot fewer pages with default template text sitting in there making me look lazy.</p>

<p>Download it <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/2007/Select-Next-Placeholder.py">here</a>. (Note, it needs the <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/fs/flystashweb.cgi/40de692c-e33c-01d9-12a1-c0cbe4c4d9e7">VoodooPad Python Plugin Enabler</a> )</p>
