My shared links for July 12th through July 15th:






  * [Understanding Hardware Acceleration on Mobile Browsers | Blog | Sencha](http://www.sencha.com/blog/understanding-hardware-acceleration-on-mobile-browsers/) - Understanding Hardware Acceleration on Mobile Browsers | Blog | Sencha


  * [Scientists Turn to the Web to Raise Research Funds - NYTimes.com](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/12/science/12crowd.html?_r=1) - Crowdfunding science. It can't replace existing sources, but it's a great idea for some projects.


  * [The rise and fall of the independent software developer](http://furbo.org/2011/07/13/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-independent-developer/) - Seeing a lot of this lately - big enough to be a target but small enough to be unable to fight.


  * [Presentation Boot Camp (aka Tufte in Twenty Minutes)](http://idmg.berkeley.edu/download/IDMG-SummerSeries-06-01-2010-TufteInTwentyMinutes.pdf) - A condensed 3-page summary of main ideas in tufte's books. 
Includes the idea of a handout - something I've used in the past and would like to use again.


  * [Rapid DHCP: Or, how do Macs get on the network so fast? : Caffeinated Bitstream](http://cafbit.com/entry/rapid_dhcp_or_how_do) - Very interesting comparison. I'm also curious what windows does here - it seems like windows xp laptops often take a long time to join a network, too.


  * [Why I will never pursue cheating again - A Computer Scientist in a Business School](http://behind-the-enemy-lines.blogspot.com/2011/07/why-i-will-never-pursue-cheating-again.html) - Reading those automated cheating reports must be depressing. 
I wonder if it'd help for the system to just send the report back to the student every time?
