A conversation view for Thunderbird: 

[Thunderbird Conversations - GitHub](https://github.com/protz/GMail-Conversation-View/wiki).

From the screenshots, it looks pretty good. I downloaded it but lost energy after realizing that it's only compatible with beta versions of Thunderbird 3.3. I have 3.0 or something, and the latest released version is 3.1, I guess. Or whatever.
