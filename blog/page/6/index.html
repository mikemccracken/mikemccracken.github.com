<blockquote><p>So all these years later I&#8217;m trying to make a very odd movie indeed, about computer chess programmers circa 1980, and perhaps deep down it&#8217;s my attempt to vicariously peek into the fantasy braniac life I ought to have pursued as a kid. It happens to be a fascinating era for the field. As computers were exploding into the public sphere, and regular folks were just getting used to seeing them in the workplace, or home, a group of geniuses at the vanguard of the technology were trying to teach it what seemed like an almost unimaginable skill&#8211;could these machines, these glorified calculators, ever conquer the human world champion in chess? Obviously a human being would have to be a genius to be the world chess champ, so if they could get a computer to do it, the computer would have to acquire a kind of genius, right?</p></blockquote>

<time datetime="2011-07-06T07:05:48-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jul 6<span>th</span>, 2011</time>
        
         | <a href="/2011/07/voodoopad-omnifocus-and-terminal-integration-wish-list/#disqus_thread">Comments</a>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here are some features I want but I&#8217;ll never have time to write the scripts for VoodooPad to do.</p>

<p>I use VP mostly as a running log of notes, shell commands and todos. I also use OmniFocus for task tracking, but sometimes it&#8217;s easier to just start typing in VP and work out the tasks later. So I often end up with VP pages that have a bunch of todos mixed in with project headers and miscellaneous notes.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking some integration would be nice. I want an <del><a href="http://orgmode.org/">emacs org-mode</a></del> (update: I meant <a href="http://www.isi.edu/~johnh/SOFTWARE/NOTES_MODE/">notes-mode</a>) style &#8220;new day&#8221; script that creates a new page for the day and does the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>adds a link to the new page to the previous note page</li>
<li>moves any pending todos (I mark them as lines starting with a &lt;# todo #> placeholder so I can jump to them) off yesterday&#8217;s page and into OmniFocus</li>
<li>starts a new header (line starting with #, in bold) in the new page for every header that had leftover todos. These headers usually correspond to projects in OmniFocus.</li>
<li>adds new headers and todo lines for any tasks that are due today</li>
</ul>


<p>I want to have VP autocomplete project names from OmniFocus when I start a header line. Then add a link next to the new header pointing to the last page containing that header.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d also like to have OmniFocus update the VP document when I check off a task in OF - I want to use VP as a log, so I can track down when I did something. Maybe projects should all have their own VP pages, that are kind of an auto-updated index of progress on the tasks.</p>

<p>It&#8217;d also be nice if when I edited a todo line in VP, it could update OF. I guess I want VP to be an supplemental synchronized view onto my OF tasks.</p>

<p>For the Terminal: I do a lot of copying and pasting shell commands into VP so I can remember things like important paths, or the exact configure settings I used to build something two years ago. This is really useful, but it&#8217;d be nice if it was easier to do without leaving the terminal. Ideally I could just prefix a command with something like &#8216;@&#8217; to add it to the current page in VP (or &#8216;@pagename#headername&#8217; to get fancy). You could get this with a script named &#8216;@&#8217; - on your local machine. But it also has to work when you&#8217;re working remotely, so it will get a little more complicated.</p>

<p>Finally - this is something I wanted to try doing with an InputManager before that mechanism went away: I&#8217;d like CamelCase links in every text field on the system (probably with some exceptions) to automatically link to VP pages. But it sounds like the days of modifying system-wide behavior on Macs are history, so I&#8217;ll probably never get this. Who knows, maybe it would&#8217;ve been a disaster.</p>

<p>I always thought the path to improvement in work computing was more and deeper integration between 3rd-party apps, as well as more system functionality that&#8217;s usable by all those apps, but it looks to me* like in OS X we&#8217;re only getting the latter.</p>

<p><em>* - since 10.7 is about to come out, it might be worth pointing out that I have no special advance developer info. I haven&#8217;t even been a dev program member for a few years now.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My shared links for June 30th to July 1st:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://ios.wordpress.org/">WordPress for iOS</a> - I didn&#8217;t know this existed. Looks pretty nice.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/hotdogsladies/status/86535776535449601">@hotdogsladies on the email charter idea</a> -</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.wordyard.com/2011/06/30/circles-facebooks-reality-failure-is-googles-opportunity/">Circles: Facebook&#8217;s reality failure is Google+&#8217;s opportunity</a> - He likes the ability to group people differently, something Facebook sort of has, but never made easy. I like the idea too, but I think they could go further - sometimes you might want the type of relationship you have to be public. I&#8217;m not on G+, so I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s possible. Can you make circle names public sometimes?</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/30/we-have-to-fix-e-mail/">We Have to Fix E-Mail - NYTimes.com</a> - Pogue likes the email charter. He adds a few good ideas that seem like common sense to me. Like Chuq said, isn&#8217;t this just netiquette?</p></li>
