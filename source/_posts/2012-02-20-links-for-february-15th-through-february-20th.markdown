My shared links for February 15th through February 20th:






  * [Firebirds Restaurants » Blog Archive » Firebirds Chicken Pasta](http://www.firebirdsrestaurants.com/blog/?p=553) I made the sauce. Delicious! I can only assume the whole thing will come together. 


  * [Parsing Techniques - Second Edition](http://dickgrune.com/Books/PTAPG_2nd_Edition/) - 


  * [DEVONsphere Express -- Make your Mac smarter - DEVONtechnologies](http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonsphere/devonsphere-express.html) - Context aware search. Menu extra for 10.6.6+
(See also my XRA, nat.org/dashboard, and others. nice looking realization of the dream by DEVONtech... 


  * [](http://www.stanford.edu/~stinson/cs240/cs240_1/revs/superpages.txt) - Superpages allow each entry in the TLB to map a large physical memory
region into a virtual address space. INCREASES TLB coverage; REDUCES TLB
misses; 

Challenges of superpages:
(1) superpage allocation & promotion
(2) fragmentation control
