I've just put up the website for my current project (to be part of my Ph.D. dissertation work): [LENS](http://www.cse.ucsd.edu/~mmccrack/lens/), a framework for program information manipulation that presents a uniform interface to selective user and automated queries about many types of program metrics, including success and diagnostic information about compiler optimizations and code generation.

I'm not sure how many readers of my weblog will be interested, but there's a link to a technical report on there if you want the gory details.

Feedback and questions are very welcome - the more opportunities I get to explain what I'm doing, the better I get at it.
