  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve recently seen the concept of <em>delight</em> in software brought up in a couple different places, and I just wanted to cheer it on.</p>

<p>Jesper at <a href="http://waffle.wootest.net">waffle</a> is starting an open-source web browser project to revive the spirit of OmniWeb, called <a href="http://waffle.wootest.net/2010/04/18/rouse-involvement/">rouse</a>. He coins the phrase &ldquo;delight innovation&rdquo;. I love that phrase. He&rsquo;s talking about taking a browser, something that&rsquo;s relatively stable, and looking for ways to make it noticeably better again. I love that impulse &ndash; it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m hoping to see in email clients too.</p>

<p>Another place that delight showed up (along with Surprise and Joy), was at <a href="http://52weeksofux.com">52 weeks of UX</a> in a post called <a href="http://52weeksofux.com/post/531355592/design-for-delight">&ldquo;design for delight&rdquo;</a>. That post  seemed to be a little more about the parts of design that don&rsquo;t affect functionality, but do add personality. I really agree with this angle too &ndash; I like a program that has little details that are <a href="http://borkware.com/quickies/single?id=319">just for fun</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m signing up for a couple of public mailing lists to test how the clients help me handle the firehose of potentially-relevant emails.</p>

<p>For years now, I&rsquo;ve used GMail exclusively for public lists, because the conversation view maps really well to how I like to scan most lists &ndash; I like to see what new threads have started, and only read individual messages if the topic is interesting. I also tend to look at a thread if someone smart has weighed in, so if a client helps me pick that out, it&rsquo;s good.</p>

<p>In GMail, it only shows three or so of the people in any thread, so I have resorted to filters that star any thread where smart people are talking. I don&rsquo;t love that solution, though, since I also use stars to manually flag something as important, and I&rsquo;d rather not mix things up.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve signed up for one low-traffic list (<a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pyobjc-dev">PyObjC-dev</a>) and one higher-traffic list (<a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/llvmdev">LLVM-dev</a>), since different traffic levels are different problems. A really high-traffic list can really test a client&rsquo;s filtering and thread display design.</p>

<p>Both of these lists are <a href="http://list.org/">Mailman</a> lists, which is a very broadly used system and it&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m used to. I&rsquo;m open to hearing about other kinds of lists with different features that might change things, though &ndash; leave a comment.</p>

<p>For now I&rsquo;m starting with digests off, which I like because I prefer to see things by thread instead of by date. Some clients do unpack digests automatically, so I might test that out sometime, but I think that a client should just control when it shows you bulk mail instead of just asking the list to only send it once a day.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll report here as the traffic builds and we&rsquo;ll see how each client handles it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve grabbed a copy of <a href="http://postbox-inc.com/">Postbox</a>, so I can add it to the list of clients I&rsquo;m poking around. It&rsquo;s cross-platform, based on Thunderbird, so it shares a lot of its foundations, such as a tabbed, multi-pane interface. The settings in particular are very similar to Thunderbird 3, with just the occasional tweak.</p>

<p>However, they&rsquo;ve clearly put a lot of effort into a nice face-lift and some added features. Some of the features remind me of <a href="http://chandlerproject.org/">Chandler</a>, such as the ability to quickly make a message into a &lsquo;todo&rsquo;, and to edit messages in place.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be curious to see how many of these differences work. Editing messages in place doesn&rsquo;t seem like something I&rsquo;m ever going to want to do, but I&rsquo;d be interested to hear why someone else would.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ve also added twitter and facebook support, which I haven&rsquo;t investigated yet, but at first kind of goes against my email client religion &ndash; I&rsquo;m not convinced that adding new protocols is the way to make clients better. However, there&rsquo;s definitely a growing feeling that we have too many inboxes now. That&rsquo;s a theme echoed in the <a href="https://mozillalabs.com/raindrop/">Mozilla Raindrop</a> project, too. So maybe this will appeal to people who want everything dumped into one program. For now, I&rsquo;m not sold.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also one of the few clients you can actually <em>pay</em> for, which is interesting.</p>

<p>To revisit a couple of earlier topics, the unread count badge is the same as in Thunderbird 3 &ndash; no way to turn it off. (And they&rsquo;ve kept the option to bounce and annoy on new mail. I didn&rsquo;t try it to see if it works.)</p>

<p>The model for allowing images in HTML mail is a small improvement on Thunderbird 3. You can allow it once, or just whitelist the sender &ndash; you will still get the sender as a full entry in your Contacts list, but it adds it quietly, without bugging you for the first name of Mr. Noreply. I guess I don&rsquo;t mind it as much, but contact list pollution still annoys me.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot of Postbox telling me it&rsquo;s blocked some images. You can also see their &lsquo;todo&rsquo; and &lsquo;edit&rsquo;  buttons &ndash; to turn the message into a todo or edit it in place, and the summary pane on the right side that shows some info about the sender and lists links and attachments.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l0xkw2y44M1qz505e.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In this screenshot, you can see it using that pane to list some attachments. However, what it&rsquo;s listing is attached images that are used inline in the HTML message. I&rsquo;d prefer that it didn&rsquo;t treat those as first-class &ldquo;attachments&rdquo;, even though they technically are.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A little while ago I noticed the <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/raindrop/">Mozilla Raindrop</a> project. It&rsquo;s an interesting project in Mozilla Labs by the Thunderbird team.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s trying to rethink how messaging (in general, not just email) should work &ndash; using open web technologies. On the surface it sounds like Google Wave, but I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s aiming a little lower &ndash; trying to take existing protocols and build software that handles them all together in a better way. I also think it&rsquo;s a better approach than Wave, focusing on designing a single artifact that people will want to use instead of a framework technology demo, which is what Wave always seemed to me.</p>

<p>It looks like it&rsquo;s not intended to be a native desktop (or mobile) client &ndash; they mention running it on servers, and it depends on Python and CouchDB, which would preclude it running on the iPhone OS.</p>

<p>One of the things I like about it is the way they&rsquo;re trying to use a classification of emails &ndash; obviously, not all mails are equal. They fall somewhere in a range between spam and important personal (or work) messages. A big class is &ldquo;bulk&rdquo; mail &ndash; mail that&rsquo;s useful but not necessarily of a conversation involving you. Mailing lists, promotional mails you&rsquo;ve asked for, facebook/twitter notifications might all fall into this category, and it&rsquo;s a great idea for a mailer to do something different with them. At the least, it should let you ignore them if you&rsquo;re just trying to do a quick processing pass of new mail.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://blogs.mozillamessaging.com/raindropdesign/">Raindrop design blog</a> has some good posts (with plenty of screenshots) outlining their current approach.</p>

<p>Marco Arment <a href="http://www.marco.org/519621380">wrote yesterday</a> about mobile computing being more exciting than what he called &ldquo;Desk&rdquo; computing. I&rsquo;m a fan of Marco&rsquo;s writing, and I usually agree with him, but that post got me thinking. I can&rsquo;t argue that mobile isn&rsquo;t exciting, but I disagree with his assertion that desktop computing is a solved problem. He&rsquo;s right that the pace of innovation has slowed. Certainly the last couple of OS X releases have fewer and fewer compelling differences. In fact, I&rsquo;m writing this on OS X 10.5 &mdash; 10.6 didn&rsquo;t impress me enough to make me bother upgrading.</p>

<p>Still, when Marco asks what I want out of 10.7, I think &ldquo;what <em>don&rsquo;t</em> I want&rdquo;?</p>

<p>I think there&rsquo;s tons of room to improve on and even rethink the workstation.</p>

<p>Maybe now that the consumer train has shifted toward more custom-designed tools for browsing, games, and social apps, there&rsquo;s room for workstation OSs to grow in ways that might improve them without worrying about leaving the home user behind (or boring them).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not asking for unintuitive design. What I&rsquo;m asking for is powerful tools &ndash; system and apps &ndash; for people who use computers for work every day. I certainly hope that these power tools will be built with elegance and style. I&rsquo;m not asking for dual cameras and four speakers.</p>

<p>Market forces have limited development of crucial daily-use work tools to what will appeal to the home &amp; leisure market. For instance, Apple ships Mail and iCal with the OS. Both are fine programs, but are clearly trying to ride the line between work features such as meeting planning, and consumer features like stationery. Meanwhile, the market for alternatives is limited, and even some of the alternatives have taken the approach of adding consumer-related features. <a href="http//postbox-inc.com/">Postbox</a>, for instance, has added facebook and twitter support. That&rsquo;s not helping me get work done &ndash; quite the opposite, really.</p>

<p>But am I really just talking about incremental improvements and a few more work-oriented features here and there? I don&rsquo;t think so. To be more specific about what kind of big improvements I think are possible in desktop systems, I did a few minutes of brainstorming. Here&rsquo;s what I came up with:</p>

<p>Like the personal jetpack, I&rsquo;m still waiting for the system that knows what I&rsquo;m trying to do and co-ordinates to help me get it done. The one that learns (even crudely!) about my habits and the time of day, my colleagues, their schedules, etc. The one with this knowledge baked in everywhere in the system. For instance, it knows which app&rsquo;s notifications can be ignored for later.</p>

<p>As a start, I&rsquo;d even settle for a single system that actually uses all the good ideas that have come up in the past 30 years. Let&rsquo;s at least catch up to Douglas Engelbart&rsquo;s vision of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-Line_System#cite_note-3">NLS</a> system for augmenting collective knowledge work before we call it a day.</p>

<p>Good search everywhere has been a real improvement, but what about full support for smart annotations for files, events, people and other data? The BeOS file system comes to mind. Search is better when there&rsquo;s better info to search for. If I push it a little, some smart background prediction of categories for documents that&rsquo;d help me find them later &mdash; that couldn&rsquo;t hurt. Why doesn&rsquo;t a file know who emailed it to me?</p>

<p>Another blast from the past &ndash; maybe OpenDoc was a stretch, but more open document formats and easier flowing data between applications isn&rsquo;t a bad idea &ndash; can we expand on that?</p>

<p>This one ties in with mobile devices &ndash; Real, honest to god multi-computer network syncing. It can be done &ndash; it should be baked in! What if your filesystem was actually an easily merge-able version-controlled document oriented database like CouchDB? Can we use some ideas from distributed version control to make sharing documents on disconnected filesystems work right automatically? I still think the best solution doesn&rsquo;t depend on storing everything on servers (especially public servers).</p>

<p>That leads to the oft-repeated idea of getting rid of &ldquo;saving&rdquo;. I shouldn&rsquo;t have to commit changes &ndash; maybe I want to tag a version, but the data should always be written to disk.</p>

<p>Every app should be able to know about communication (mail, IM, SMS, whatever) that might affect what you&rsquo;re working on in it. Today&rsquo;s apps have uniform access to your files &ndash; but not to your messages. This seems like a bad historical distinction &ndash; they&rsquo;re both relevant data. For example, why do I have to &ldquo;save attachments&rdquo;? It&rsquo;s already on my disk…</p>

<p>What about application and system scripting that <em>really works</em> &ndash; that&rsquo;s easy enough for quick things but powerful and fast enough to grow a real program from? Let me start them as visual or spoken one-off commands but then edit and share them as text.</p>

<p>System support for Quicksilver/Launchbar/Ubiquity-style text command lines. Tie this into the scripting system. Make it feel like I tell the <em>computer</em> what to do instead of finding the right app to tell, opening it, etc.</p>

<p>System-wide hypertext &ndash; I should be able to create robust links between document parts, messages, people, and other entities. It should be fast to view an annotated list of changes across versions of a document, showing who did them and what they said about it in emails. This shouldn&rsquo;t have to all reside on some central server to work.</p>

<p>Do you have any ideas to add to the list?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l0ko62FuR81qz505e.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Apple Mail&rsquo;s &ldquo;Send again&rdquo; feature is handy &ndash; it takes a message and creates a duplicate of it, ready to either edit or re-send exactly as-is. It&rsquo;s a bit of a mystery, though, and I bet it isn&rsquo;t used much.</p>

<p>The problem is that the wording and keyboard shortcut don&rsquo;t say enough about what&rsquo;s really about to happen. You could be forgiven for guessing that since ⌘-D sends new mails out onto the wire, it&rsquo;ll just send the old mail &ndash; unedited &ndash; out on the wire, too.
There&rsquo;s no hint that you get to edit it.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also the possibility for error, since pressing ⌘-D once gives you a new mail with the old contents, which a second ⌘-D will send right away, with no undo. (Lack of undo in sending is a topic for another post, of course)</p>

<p>Also unexpected because of the name, the message doesn&rsquo;t have to be one you sent. If you invoke &ldquo;Send again&rdquo; on a message you received, you&rsquo;ll get a new message with the same recipients, from you. I&rsquo;m having a hard time imagining why I&rsquo;d ever use this. Maybe it&rsquo;d save a copy and paste when sending a copy of something that I don&rsquo;t want to just forward, but that&rsquo;s a stretch. How often does that happen?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a handy feature, but it needs a better name and a better shortcut.</p>

<p>Why is it handy? Sometimes I write a draft of an email to the outside world, then send it to team members for review. Then later, I want to edit that draft, incorporate their suggestions and send it off anew. That&rsquo;s when I use &ldquo;Send again&rdquo;. But I only discovered it by accident.</p>

<p>Despite this use case, this seems like a feature that probably isn&rsquo;t worth the effort and extra UI clutter.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a post from the recesses of memory.</p>

<p>Back in 2004, Brent Simmons said:</p>

<blockquote><p>… your feedreader, like your browser and email app, is a hub of information. It makes sense to want to route information from the hub to other applications.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a great point &ndash; and I&rsquo;d like to expand on it. I think it goes further than just being able to send data from your email client to other programs. Data should be easier to send in <em>both</em> directions.</p>

<p>Most email clients want to be your only interface to your mail data. Since email communication can affect everything we do on a workstation, every program should be able to look at and update your email store, even triggering checks or controlling how you are notified of new messages. What program is better able to determine what you&rsquo;re likely focused on than the one you&rsquo;re currently using?</p>

<p>The best way to handle this would involve some system-level support, so the largest set of applications could use it. I&rsquo;m not holding my breath…</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a minor obsession with email clients. I&rsquo;m fascinated with how people use email and how clients have (and haven&rsquo;t) evolved over the last 40 years.</p>

<p>So, I started a separate blog on Tumblr to explore email clients, called <a href="http://mikechecksmail.tumblr.com/">mike checks mail</a>.</p>

<p>The idea is to look at clients available now on OS X, and discuss their features and their flaws. It&rsquo;s basically very focused app criticism.</p>

<p>The first few posts have focused on the three free apps I use daily &ndash; Apple Mail, GMail and Thunderbird. Eventually I want to explore the other major mail clients currently on the market, including Entourage, Postbox, Eudora, and Outspring. I&rsquo;d also like to dive into other platforms, to avoid reinventing something smart that&rsquo;s been in (say) emacs for 30 years.</p>

<p>Take a look, and <a href="http://mikechecksmail.tumblr.com/ask/">send me questions and suggestions for topics</a>. Let&rsquo;s geek out on mail clients…</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One common misguided feature of mail clients is putting an attention-grabbing red badge somewhere showing the count of unread messages in your inbox (or some other folder).
It&rsquo;s worst if it&rsquo;s on the dock badge and you don&rsquo;t hide the dock &ndash; then there&rsquo;s no way short of quitting the app to completely avoid this visual interruption. Sure you can just ignore it, but why should you have to?</p>

<p>A quick survey of the three main mail clients I&rsquo;ve been using shows that they all have some way of putting unread counts in your line of sight, and only Apple Mail (I use v 3.6 on OS X 10.5) really lets you shut it up &ndash; you can tell it not to badge the dock at all. If you had a subset of mail that really does need to interrupt you, you can also restrict the unread count to a particular smart mailbox.</p>

<p>The smart mailbox feature is interesting. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine what kind of email is just important enough to show the unread count for, but not important enough for a more obvious alert. I&rsquo;m sure the feature comes from a different viewpoint on mail &ndash; perhaps the idea is that you&rsquo;ll never read all your messages, so you want to see a count of how many &ldquo;important&rdquo; ones you need to read. I think that&rsquo;s just treating a symptom, though, honestly.</p>

<p>On the other end of the scale, Thunderbird 3 has no way that I can find to turn off the dock badge:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l07fezvyeh1qz505e.tiff" alt="TBird dock badge" /></p>

<p>They do give you a way to make it more annoying, though &ndash; you can have the dock icon bounce for every new mail! I can&rsquo;t think of any good reason for that, except that at some point when the dock was new, it was fun to make things bounce.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l07fj1MSaz1qz505e.tiff" alt="Tbird quiet prefs" /></p>

<p>Finally, GMail &ndash; I take my GMail more or less straight-up, in a dedicated browser app with no extra frills, that I wrote in 2006 (see post <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/2006/05/webmail-is-not-web-browsing/">here</a> ). I understand that apps like <a href="http://mailplaneapp.com">Mailplane</a> add some nice desktop integration, and multiple account support, but I don&rsquo;t really need that stuff. So, assuming a basic straight-up GMail, it has no dock badge, but it does show an unread count in the title bar:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l07fvlL0011qz505e.png" alt="gmail unread" /></p>

<p>While that&rsquo;ll show up in some menus and on mouse-over in Exposé, it&rsquo;s really not a big deal. I&rsquo;d say that GMail (in the browser) and Apple Mail are about the same in terms of visual distraction, once you change the prefs in Mail.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d prefer that an email app didn&rsquo;t do anything to make all unread messages look like something important you need to fix. If I&rsquo;m going to check the mail, I&rsquo;ll notice the messages. If I&rsquo;m not about to check the mail, I don&rsquo;t want to know. I think this is best for everyone, too &ndash; like the insistence on filing vs. searching, it&rsquo;s an outdated habit from a time when email volumes were lower.</p>

<p>Either a message is important enough for a major interruption &ndash; a pop-up window with a beep, for instance &ndash; or it&rsquo;s OK to let it sit for a while. The unread status alone is a poor substitute for &ldquo;important&rdquo;, and we should move past it.</p>
