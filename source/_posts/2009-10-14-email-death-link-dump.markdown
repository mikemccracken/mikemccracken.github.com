A recent Wall Street Journal article [noted](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203803904574431151489408372.html) (pay link) the rise of alternatives to email.

And surprisingly, there were a good number of lucid and interesting comments in the [slashdot thread](http://tech.slashdot.org/story/09/10/14/016257/Yet-Another-Premature-Declaration-of-Emails-Death?art_pos=1) about the article. Provided you filter out comments with a score of 3 and lower...
