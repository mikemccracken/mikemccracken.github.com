My shared links for June 29th:






  * [Postbox 2.5 Now Available! -- Postbox](http://www3.postbox-inc.com/?/blog/entry/postbox_2_5_now_available/) - Why is 64-bit support the first bullet point?


  * [Avoiding email bankruptcy (part 1) - Chuqui 3.0](http://www.chuqui.com/2011/06/avoiding-email-bankruptcy-part-1/) - Part 1 of 2: learn to recognize that email takes time and block out time to deal with it


  * [Avoiding email bankruptcy (part 2) - Chuqui 3.0](http://www.chuqui.com/2011/06/avoiding-email-bankruptcy-part-2/) - Part 2: Chuq explains his email workflow. Nice and sane, very similar to what I do.
