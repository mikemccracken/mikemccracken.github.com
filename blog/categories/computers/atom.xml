    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From the National Academies:</p>

<p><a href="http://nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12980">The Future of Computing Performance: Game Over or Next Level?</a>.</p>

<p>A nice, thorough explanation of the current challenges in computing performance, ranging from transistor-level power vs. speed problems, up to how to program the circuits we&rsquo;re likely to end up with.</p>

<p>Also includes a bonus reprint of two classic papers, Gordon Moore&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cramming More Components onto Integrated Circuits&rdquo; from 1965 &ndash; that&rsquo;s the paper you might expect it is, and Robert Dennard&rsquo;s &ldquo;Design of Ion-Implanted MOSFET’s with Very Small Physical Dimensions&rdquo;, which I was less familiar with.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An interesting post about how to evaluate a research idea. Basically, try to think about the bounds: what&rsquo;s the maximum impact? Includes some good rules of thumb, like pay attention to physical constraints like the speed of light :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I read John Siracusa&rsquo;s &ldquo;Copland 2010&rdquo; article back in &lsquo;05, and listened to his recent update of it on his podcast. I wasn&rsquo;t very convinced, but I couldn&rsquo;t figure out quite how to say why. Today I think Guy nailed it:</p>

<blockquote><p>Siracusa argues that abstraction is the all consuming beast of computer science, I think he’s mostly correct but I can’t help but feel he’s more worried about abstracting yesterday’s issues than tomorrow’s.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From <a href="http://axisofeval.blogspot.com/2011/03/truth-is-stranger-than-fiction.html">The Axis of Eval: &ldquo;Truth IS stranger than fiction&rdquo;</a>: Chuck McManis explains the cancellation and subsequent fame of Java.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to me how often you hear about these overnight successes that took years to develop and were canceled, given up for dead, etc. many times.</p>

<p>I remember hearing similar stories about Self and Erlang at HOPL-3, the History of Programming Languages conference. Maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t bet on the success of a new language unless it&rsquo;s been cancelled or abandoned at least once?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From the always-interesting Canonical Design blog:
<a href="http://design.canonical.com/2011/03/introducing-overlay-scrollbars-in-unity/">Introducing Overlay Scrollbars in Unity</a>. (Who wouldn&rsquo;t love to see an Apple Design blog? It&rsquo;s fun to follow along as some serious, talented people rethink stuff we use everyday…)</p>

<p>Take a look at the video &ndash; and stick with it all the way through. At first I didn&rsquo;t like it but now I&rsquo;m a fan. I like that they&rsquo;ve expanded usable screen real estate by getting rid of the everpresent thumb, but kept a subtle visual indicator that there&rsquo;s more content &ndash; there&rsquo;s a small ~2px bar that scales like current thumbs do.</p>

<p>My only concern would be that the little mini-thumb is too small and it will sometimes not be obvious that you can scroll. I think this happens on iOS, too &ndash; maybe it&rsquo;s not such a big deal.</p>
