My last wordpress upgrade was a long time ago, and it's going to stay that way.

These posts about blogging are really only interesting years later,
and only to me, when I look back and think about what I was doing that
I thought I had time to mess with blogging software.

[Last time](/blog/2005/12/25/test-wordpress/) I made a major change was switching to wordpress from
blosxom back in December 2005, over Christmas break. I was at my
parents' house and had nothing to do after everyone went to bed at 9pm. 

These days I can't remember the feeling of having nothing to do, but I
went ahead and switched things up anyway, exactly because I don't have
time to mess with things like upgrading wordpress. 

So I'm going with octopress on github user pages. I like generating a
static site from text files, and github pages are sort of convenient. (sort of)
