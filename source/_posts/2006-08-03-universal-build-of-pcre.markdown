Dear Lazyweb, I wanted to polish up and push out a project I started more than two years ago in time for WWDC, but it requires [PCRE](http://www.pcre.org), and I can't seem to get PCRE to build for i386 in less than twenty minutes. Does anyone know of a universal build of a recent PCRE somewhere (or good specific instructions to build one?)

Thanks,

-mike
