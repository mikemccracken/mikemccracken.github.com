From Flying Meat, [VoodooPad](http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad) 3.5 is out.
([release notes here](http://www.flyingmeat.com/fs/flystashweb.cgi/2dc35f78-ac3e-01dc-01d4-c0cbe4c4bd91)).

It's a solid update, including welcome image-editor integration and more. I thought I'd point out my favorite feature in the release notes:

"You can now edit pages and sort the results in the search window (woo!)."

I like this because it matches a kind of manual refactoring habit I picked up with Project Builder / XCode's excellent "Find in Project…" window - I search for a keyword that marks places I need to look at and edit the files right in the search window. (Note: ['occur-mode' and kin](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Other-Repeating-Search.html) are a powerful way to do the same in Emacs…)

It's a powerful habit if you plan for it, by using comments in code to keep track of what you've touched when making a lot of cross-cutting changes, like `# @addsearch` Then when you think you're done with a change, you can run a quick search to see if you forgot to fix anything.

Sometimes in VoodooPad notes, I'll write in placeholders like that comment when I don't have a bit of information yet, and now I can follow my trails the same way I do in code.

Thanks, Gus!
