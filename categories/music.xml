In effect, we do not seek utility but prestige. There is no prestige in tool-making, cooking or farming. To maximize your prestige, you must rise up to the leisure class: you work must not be immediately useful."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://beets.radbox.org/"&gt;beets: the music geek's media organizer&lt;/a&gt; - The purpose of beets is to get your music collection right once and for all. It catalogs your collection, automatically improving its metadata as it goes using the MusicBrainz database. (It also downloads cover art for albums it imports.) Then it provides a bouquet of tools for manipulating and accessing your music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because beets is designed as a library, it can do almost anything you can imagine for your music collection. Via plugins, beets becomes a panacea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embed and extract album art from files' tags.
Listen to your library with a music player that speaks the MPD protocol and works with a staggering variety of interfaces.
Fetch lyrics for all your songs from databases on the Web.
Manage your MusicBrainz music collection.
Analyze music files' metadata from the command line.
Clean up crufty tags left behind by other, less-awesome tools.
Browse your music library graphically through a Web browser and play it in any browser that supports HTML5 Audio.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>apps</category><category>framework</category><category>gmail</category><category>haskell</category><category>links</category><category>maps</category><category>music</category><category>ocd</category><category>pinboard-links</category><category>plugins</category><category>policy</category><category>programming</category><category>ranking</category><category>score</category><category>statistics</category><category>tagging</category><category>terrorism</category><category>web</category><guid>http://michael-mccracken.net/2012/04/links-haskell-music-ocd-tools-terrorism-probability-for-ranking-things.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Apr 2012 23:16:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Links for September 4th through September 6th</title><link>http://michael-mccracken.net/2011/09/links-for-september-4th-through-september-6th.html</link><dc:creator>Michael McCracken</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;My shared links for September 4th through September 6th:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before he was famous for popularizing bossa nova with "The Girl from Ipanema" in the early 1960s, saxophonist Stan Getz recorded with small jazz groups all through the '50s. Jazz critic Kevin Whitehead says a new reissue shows Getz was one of the best at playing pretty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really love Fresh Air. I used to listen to it every day after school while playing Crystal Quest in my room. Every time I hear Terry Gross' voice, I get a bit of a rush like I'm goofing off instead of doing my homework.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>music</category><guid>http://michael-mccracken.net/2011/04/fresh-air-stan-getz-in-the-50s.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2011 17:09:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>iTunes Skip Count</title><link>http://michael-mccracken.net/2006/10/itunes-skip-count.html</link><dc:creator>Michael McCracken</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;It's been mentioned before, for example &lt;a href="http://digg.com/apple/New_iTunes_7_SKIP_COUNT_feature"&gt;on Digg&lt;/a&gt;, but iTunes 7 has a new feature that counts the number of times you've &lt;em&gt;skipped&lt;/em&gt; a track, which is defined as playing the song for at least two seconds but no longer than twenty (after which it is counted as played fully).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm curious how they chose twenty seconds as the cutoff - when I was working on an (unreleased and unfinished) project for generating smart shuffles, I defined skips as not listening past the first fifteen seconds, but didn't count a full play until the song ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's an interesting feature, and it's apparently kept up to date by some iPods, so I can see it helping me keep bad songs off my small iPod by using it in a smart playlist rule. However, often I find myself skipping songs I really like because I'm just not feeling them at the moment. So - how about the option of a smart playlist rule that lets me define a skip percentage? If I skip a song far more often than I play it, then it's a pretty good bet I don't need it on my iPod.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>computers</category><category>mac</category><category>music</category><guid>http://michael-mccracken.net/2006/10/itunes-skip-count.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2006 02:16:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Matt Pond PA</title><link>http://michael-mccracken.net/2006/03/matt-pond-pa.html</link><dc:creator>Michael McCracken</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I meant to post this just after the show, but I didn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;a href="http://mattpondpa.com/"&gt;Matt Pond PA&lt;/a&gt; play on March 7th at the Epicentre in Mira Mesa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The band sounded great, fitting a sometimes symphonic sound from a few band members into a smallish low-ceilinged venue (okay, teen center). I was impressed that their sometimes melancholy songs translated so well to a live performance, and as usual it was fantastic to see actual people play favorite familiar songs in person. As compared to their albums, live, they &lt;em&gt;rocked&lt;/em&gt; a little more - which is only right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the band fails to even mention the date on their running tour blog, and I think I know why. Mira Mesa in general, and the Epicentre in particular, occupy an all-too familiar spot right in the nexus of &lt;em&gt;lame&lt;/em&gt;. It's hard for me not to feel a little sad whenever I drive through the place, a plateau of asphalt wedged between freeways and topped with a layer-cake of condos, strip malls and "communities". The Epicentre is not a bar or any kind of concert hall - it is a teen center directly across from the local high school. The bathrooms smelled like chalk and institutional cleaners, and although I'm sure I'd have visited the place if it'd existed near my high school, it was clearly trying too hard to be both cool and safe, two things which can never coexist, especially if you're a minor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a little embarrassed for my adopted city because too many bands will experience San Diego as a place where they draw ten percent of their usual crowds and are forced to play at the diner from Saved by the Bell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, Matt Pond PA was very good, and I really hope they don't hold a grudge.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>music</category><guid>http://michael-mccracken.net/2006/03/matt-pond-pa.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2006 05:40:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Takk… etc.</title><link>http://michael-mccracken.net/2006/01/takk-etc.html</link><dc:creator>Michael McCracken</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I bought three new albums with my iTunes gift card this Christmas, and I thought I'd share how they've turned out so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takk… by Sigur Ros. I bought this because I liked their last album, the parentheses one, and because John Allison's &lt;a href="http://www.scarygoround.com/?date=20051226"&gt;hilarious year end album review&lt;/a&gt; seemed to imply it was more of the same: "Everyone is fooled!" I find that I do like it just as much, but unlike all those Untitled songs in the last one, I don't mind listening to these songs when the sun is out. A fun game for casual fans is to play songs from the two albums together at random, and try to guess which album they're from. I call this the "Coldplay game".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late Registration by Kanye West. Everyone says it's great, and I don't listen to radio or watch MTV anyway, so I can't be annoyed by overplayed singles. I really like this album. Great for playing really loud while driving someone else's car across the desert at perfectly legal speeds. Luckily I live in Southern California, so nobody looks at me funny when my pale white fingers crank the volume on the way to my hockey game. I think my favorite track here is "Addiction".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final Straw by Snow Patrol. I've listened to it a few times already, it seems like there's a few great songs in there, a few I won't ever remember, and I have a nagging feeling that this will become another Josh Joplin Group, who I loved for three weeks and almost always skip past now. Which would be sad. If there was one song to get from this album, I think it'd be "Chocolate", not "Run", which was the big single. So there it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
