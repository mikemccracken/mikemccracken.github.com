The excellent ["Take Control"](http://takecontrolbooks.com) series of Mac ebooks has updated  ["Take Control of OS X Backups"](http://www.takecontrolbooks.com/backup-macosx.html) to version 2.0.

I have gotten a lot of use out of their other books. ["Take Control of Your Airport Network"](http://www.takecontrolbooks.com/AirPort.html) saved me a lot of frustration setting up a network for my roommates, and ["Take Control of Spam with Apple Mail"](http://www.takecontrolbooks.com/spam-apple-mail.html) is what led me to buy  [SpamSieve](http://c-command.com/spamsieve/), so the book deserves part of the credit for solving my spam problem.

So, when I saw that they had a book about backups, I jumped at the chance to get some more good practical advice. Since I already have a copy of Retrospect sitting around gathering dust, I was happy to see a great section dedicated to setting up a recommended backup plan using Retrospect. That section was helpful enough to get me back on track with regular full duplicate backups as well as the incremental backups of selected files I was already doing. That alone was well worth the cost of the book.
