From [C-Command Blog -  EagleFiler 1.4.7](http://c-command.com/blog/2009/07/28/eaglefiler-147/): a bunch of nice refinements.

I use EagleFiler to keep track of reference documents that I get in emails. Presentations, reports, etc - the kind of thing that would usually just get stored in the mail archive. Because I want a complete mail archive *and* a fast way to get to the important stuff, I keep the important stuff in EagleFiler so I can add tags and searches don't get a lot of false hits.
