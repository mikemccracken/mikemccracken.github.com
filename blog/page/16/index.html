  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a short one, but it might help someone with debugging someday.</p>

<p>A while back, we had some code that was checking errno, then using the NSLocalizedString macro to get a localized error message, but it checked errno again later. Only the app isn&#8217;t localized yet. There&#8217;s no Localizable.strings file, so when NSBundle -localizedStringForKey gets called, even though it fails gracefully, it still ends up setting errno to &#8220;ENOENT&#8221;, or &#8220;file not found&#8221;.</p>

<p>So the lesson is - in case you&#8217;re seeing weird behavior where errno is changing after you check it, make sure you&#8217;re not using any system calls that might set it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&#8217;re thinking of writing a commercially successful <em>pro</em> email client for Mac OS X, here&#8217;s some advice along the lines of what I wrote <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/wp/2007/07/05/it-could-work-a-3rd-party-email-client-for-os-x/">yesterday</a>:</p>

<p><em>Make sure you&#8217;ve tried a lot of email clients.</em> Try everything you can get your hands on. Really use each one - figure out what makes it different, and what makes it powerful. Make sure you&#8217;ve tried text-only clients like mutt and pine. Lots of your target audience refuses to give those up - figure out why. Don&#8217;t just try free alternatives - peek in on big-business. Fire up Parallels and try Outlook and Notes in Windows (there may be others that are even better examples). Read up on the <a href="http://chandlerproject.org/Projects/WebHome">Chandler project</a>.</p>

<p><em>Make sure the email is always available in an open data format.</em> If this isn&#8217;t obvious, you should probably stay home. Keep a backup copy of email in something Apple Mail can read - like Unix mbox files. You can use a database for tags and whatever, but there had better be mbox files around, because your target audience won&#8217;t move into an app they can&#8217;t move out of.</p>

<p><em>Don&#8217;t start out by cloning Apple Mail.</em> If your first screenshot looks almost like Mail but does less or isn&#8217;t as pretty, it&#8217;s bad news. Mail is a big program with lots of time and effort behind it. If you try to match its feature list first before you make your client unique, you&#8217;re toast.</p>

<p><em>Pick a specific customer, and get to know their email problem.</em> Why not clone Apple Mail? Because you&#8217;re not writing for the same customer, are you? Make sure you know who your customer is, and what they actually <em>need</em>. People who want a pro app probably already have a system for to-do lists &amp; notes, so your client doesn&#8217;t need to match those features. Likewise, email pros can still use Mail to send slideshows to Momâ€¦</p>

<p>As an example, since you&#8217;re probably a programmer, think about how a programmer&#8217;s email client would be different from the standard. Maybe it does syntax highlighting. Maybe you can apply patches people send you with one click. Maybe you can create bugzilla issues from an email with one click. Or collaborate on a support email with the <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaengine/">SubEthaEngine</a>. Nobody but programmers will want to use that client, but that&#8217;s fine - there are lots of programmers. Now what about music and video editors? Graphic designers? See where I&#8217;m going?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Brent Simmons <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3425">started</a> a discussion yesterday about email apps for OS X. To summarize: Apple Mail doesn&#8217;t do enough for everyone, and the alternatives aren&#8217;t so great either. But because it is free, there&#8217;s no incentive for a third party to do better.</p>

<p>Paul Kafasis agrees, saying <a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/posts/Article/Rise-of-the-OS-2007-07-05-12-00.html">&#8220;Don&#8217;t compete with Free and Don&#8217;t compete with Apple&#8221;</a>. He draws the comparison between email apps and browsers, where there is very little money to be made as a result of the many excellent free browsers out there. He also compares the situation to music players - it seems like everyone&#8217;s got a pet feature they would add to iTunes, so there ought to be an audience for a couple music players, except competing with iTunes is just <a href="http://www.panic.com/extras/audionstory/">not a good business plan</a>.</p>

<p>I do think there is a market for a pro email client for OS X, and I&#8217;ll use another core app category to explain - Text Editors. I think they are a better analogy than music or browsers. Shipping in every Mac, TextEdit is a solid basic free editor, but everyone needs something more. Some people need styles, grammar checking, layout control, and graphics - so they move to Word, Pages, or OpenOffice.org. Clearly, there&#8217;s money to be made there, if only by Microsoft.
Other people need regex search and replace, code completion, syntax checking, block editing, etc. - so they move on to a programmer&#8217;s editor. How is the market for programmer&#8217;s editors? XCode is free and very good, emacs, vim, etc. are also free and excellent. But there <em>are</em> people making money selling text editors. People buy BBEdit, TextMate, and SubEthaEdit because these programs have important features that give you more power over something that they do all day. TextMate is my favorite example here, because it benefits from community involvement with bundles and plugins to customize and add power.</p>

<p>Does that sound familiar? It should - many of us spend more time than we&#8217;d like reading and answering email. For some, it&#8217;s their whole job. An email client that had unique and compelling features for professionals, knew its audience, had strong Mac-like design, <em>and supported community extension</em>, would be successful, just like TextMate.</p>

<p>Imagine if there was just a single bundled text editor for Macs, and we had to use it for writing everything from programming to business reports to family letters. Wouldn&#8217;t it be annoying when an update came around and they added stationery and voice notes when you wanted refactoring support and better version-control integration? &#8220;Email client&#8221; isn&#8217;t just a single app category, and it&#8217;s about time someone realized it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been dreaming of a new kind of email client, one that only lets you look at a new email once. That&#8217;s right - you get to scan it for 30 seconds and then you have to do something with it or it gets archived out of sight. And you can only look at one email at a time. I think it&#8217;d be a great way to focus on getting your inbox empty and doing something useful with each message.</p>

<p>Doing something would be replying to it, archiving or deleting it, creating a todo about it or sending it to a notes program for reference. I really think that last one&#8217;s important: Email clients aren&#8217;t for storing notes - send it somewhere else where you can link it up and annotate it more easily.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t have any suggestions about how to make your email client do this, but I have come up with something for making reference emails more useful, using VoodooPad.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://www.indev.ca/MailActOn.html">Mail Act-On</a> <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/09/15/mail-act-on/">as described by Merlin Mann</a> to quickly move messages to appropriate mailboxes, and I&#8217;ve been able to keep a clean inbox. But - I never bother to look at the emails I send to the reference folder. They&#8217;re basically useless without more context.</p>

<p>I just wrote a quick script to send selected emails to <a href="http://voodoopad.com/">voodoopad</a> as a new page so I can link to them, add notes, and then later, search those reference emails in the same context as my notes. It&#8217;s already made a big difference in how useful emails are - I can add comments to myself, find related notes in my VP doc, and since there&#8217;s now a URL for every page in my VP docs, I can even link to reference emails from outside of VP - like in iGTD.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re interested in the script, it&#8217;s here: <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/2007/NewVPPageFromEmail.scpt">NewVPPageFromEmail.scpt</a>  (control-click and save-as).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve always liked the programming-languages community website <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/">Lambda the Ultimate</a>, and recently I went looking for something similar for the High-Performance Computing community. I didn&#8217;t find exactly that*, but I did find a few great resources for news about HPC and computing research policy:</p>

<p><a href="http://hpcwire.com">HPCWire</a> is a well-known news source for HPC. It has daily news updates, and occasional columns by guests from around the industry. Most of the news is press releases from companies and government labs, but it&#8217;s nice to have a single place to check for them. However, there is apparently no RSS feed, and to get email updates, you have to buy a subscription. I haven&#8217;t, but I do check back occasionally to read the columns.</p>

<p><a href="http://supercomputingonline.com">Supercomputing Online</a> is another professional news outlet, which reads a little less like a press release,
 seems to have more coverage of academic news, and does have an RSS feed.</p>

<p><a href="http://insideHPC.com/">insideHPC.com</a> is more of a weblog than either of the first two - John E. West covers news stories in brief with some added perspective and analysis. I like his approach, and <a href="http://insidehpc.com/2007/05/02/introducing-mike/">I&#8217;ve joined him</a> to help cover academic HPC issues, both computing research and issues affecting computational scientists.</p>

<p>One of many blogs at Sun is the <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/HPC/">HPC Watercooler</a>, covering Sun&#8217;s HPC products and services, as well as some non-Sun related news. I&#8217;ve found it pretty interesting already, and I&#8217;d be interested to see weblogs from other HPC vendors.</p>

<p>Finally, a couple of blogs that are less directly related to HPC but still very relevant for computing researchers, are <a href="http://www.renci.org/blog/index.php">Dan Reed&#8217;s weblog</a> at the Renaissance Computing Institute, and the <a href="http://www.cra.org/govaffairs/blog/">CRA Computing Research Policy Blog</a>, both of which cover computing research policy and funding issues that don&#8217;t often show up in news coverage of either government or computing.</p>

<p><em>* - if anyone wants to start an LTU-alike site for HPC research, or point me to one, I&#8217;ll sign up and contribute in an instant.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The UT-Austin <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~trips/">TRIPS project</a> will be unveiling their new processor next Monday. (<a href="http://oea.cs.utexas.edu/articles/index2007/trips_unveiling07.html">event details</a>)</p>

<p>This is a pretty interesting attempt to get around the problems facing processor design today. Clock speeds have stalled, but the actual Moore&#8217;s Law - the one about transistor count, not &#8220;speed&#8221; - is still going, so we have the problem of what to do with just a lot of copies of basically the same old chip?</p>

<p>A lot of answers you hear involve pushing that complexity up to the programmer, forcing more people to become parallel programmers. This is almost certain to happen at least a little, but let&#8217;s hope we don&#8217;t have to give up on the sequential programming model completely. If you think software is bad nowâ€¦</p>

<p>The TRIPS processor is an example of another approach - placing more of the burden of finding and using parallelism onto the compiler and architecture, keeping programmers&#8217; heads above water. It&#8217;s pretty exciting to see something this different make its way into actual silicon.</p>

<p>The basic idea is that instead of a single piece of control logic organizing the actions of multiple functional units, finding concurrency within a window of instructions using reordering, the TRIPS processor is distributed at the lowest level - each functional unit is a mini-processor (called a tile), and instructions executing on separate processor tiles communicate operands directly, not through a register file. Usually this is described as executing a graph of instructions instead of a single instruction at a time.</p>

<p>Current processors certainly don&#8217;t just execute one instruction at a time, and they do plenty of moving instructions around, so I tend to see this explicit-data-graph description as just the far end of a spectrum that starts with old superscalar designs, continues through out-of-order processors and multithreaded architectures, and currently seems to end here.</p>

<p>A TRIPS processor can run four thread contexts at once, with an instruction window of 1024 instructions to reorder and 256 memory operations in flight at once. For comparison, the late &#8217;90s Tera MTA ran 128 threads at once (128 different program counters), and the 2003-vintage Cray X1 processors kept track of 512 memory operations at once. Just like TRIPS, each of those architectures required extensive compiler support for good performance.</p>

<p>A particularly interesting point is the fully partitioned L1 cache - meaning that there are multiple distributed L1 caches on the chip, so where your instructions are physically executing will be important for performance - if they&#8217;re near the cache bank holding their operands, they will execute sooner.</p>

<p>The natural question when looking at a new and interesting architecture like this, especially one that promises a tera-op on a chip, is whether it will make its way to a laptop you can buy anytime soon. I have no idea if the UT team has any industry deals in the works, but I would bet against something like this becoming mainstream quickly - the fact that these architectures rely so much on a custom compiler with aggressive optimization means that a lot of dirty work is required to move existing software to it.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to follow this project and see how their actual hardware performs.</p>

<p>The UCSD CSE department moved into a new building more than a year ago, and it still kind of feels like a hospital. Clean walls, no character.</p>

<p>My labmate Jon and I decided to try to do something about it, and this picture shows the result.</p>

<p>For the record, we shocked ourselves by getting this done completely through appropriate channels. We asked people in charge, and they were down with it. Like true champions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you spend a lot of time reading articles and research papers that you get in PDF form, then you might be interested in the latest app from the folks who brought you <a href="http://bibdesk.sf.net">BibDesk</a>.

<p>Even though we keep our research papers stored on disk as PDF, all too often we print them out to read and write notes on. There&#8217;s something missing in the experience of reading papers on a computer, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be that way.</p>

<p>Announcing <a href="http://skim-app.sf.net">Skim</a>. Skim is a PDF reading and note-taking app for Mac OS X that is designed to make reading research papers and manuals better. Just like in Preview, you can search, scan, and zoom through PDFs, but you also get some custom features for your workflow:</p>

<ul>
<li>Snapshots: if there&#8217;s a graph on page two and the description continues to page three, just draw a box around the graph with the command key down and a snapshot window pops up with the graph, and you can keep on reading with the graph in view. For more fun, minimize that snapshot window - they stick around in their own dock in the document window.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Tooltips: If a PDF has links, such as for citation references or indexes and section headings, you can click on them as usual to go to the destination, but there&#8217;s more - hover the mouse over those links and Skim will show you a tooltip with the target of the link. No more losing your place to peek at a citation! For more fun, command-click on a link to pop up a snapshot window showing the link&#8217;s destination.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Presentation and Full-screen Modes: Full-screen reading is handy. So is showing a PDF as a presentation. But they&#8217;re a little different. For instance, you might not want to show the table of contents in a presentation, but it&#8217;s nice to see it when you&#8217;re just reading by yourself. So Full-screen and Presentation are separate modes in Skim.</li>
</ul>


<p>There&#8217;s plenty more - <a href="http://skim-app.sf.net">download it</a> and take a look, and join the <a href="http://skim-app.sf.net/mailingLists.html">mailing list</a> to discuss it. There&#8217;s even a full help book in the first public beta release!</p>

<p>Many thanks to everyone who has worked on this app, and especially to Christiaan Hofman, who moved the app from a prototype to something really useful faster than I would have thought possible.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last year I wrote about my <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/wp/?p=39">new page template for VoodooPad</a>. I still use something like it - I like the uniform look and the built-in navigation starters I get in every page.</p>

<p>I got tired of all the clicking around it took to fill in the navigation every time I put in a new page, so I decided to write a script to mimic XCode&#8217;s &#8220;Select Next Placeholder&#8221; command. In XCode, if you use code completion, you might get something like this:
<code>[dict setObject:&lt;# (id) anObject #&gt; forKey:&lt;# (id)key #&gt;]</code> Then pressing Control-/ cycles the selection through those placeholders so you can replace them with whatever you want quickly.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s really handy for code, and it&#8217;s great for VoodooPad templates too. I wrote the script as a Python script plugin for VoodooPad, and it maps Command-/ to select the next placeholder, wrapping the search at the end just like XCode does. Now my new page template in VoodooPad has a few placeholders in it, and I have a lot fewer pages with default template text sitting in there making me look lazy.</p>

<p>Download it <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/2007/Select-Next-Placeholder.py">here</a>. (Note, it needs the <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/fs/flystashweb.cgi/40de692c-e33c-01d9-12a1-c0cbe4c4d9e7">VoodooPad Python Plugin Enabler</a> )</p>
