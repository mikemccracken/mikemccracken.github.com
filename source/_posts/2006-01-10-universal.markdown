Quick note - I tried to build a universal binary version of Blapp because I thought it'd be simple, but I forgot it uses a library that is built with autoconf, and apple's [basic transition instructions for autoconf projects](http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2005/tn2137.html) didn't fly in 2 minutes, so I gave up for now.
