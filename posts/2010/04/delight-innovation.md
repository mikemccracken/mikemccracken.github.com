I've recently seen the concept of *delight* in software brought up in a couple different places, and I just wanted to cheer it on.

Jesper at [waffle](http://waffle.wootest.net) is starting an open-source web browser project to revive the spirit of OmniWeb, called [rouse](http://waffle.wootest.net/2010/04/18/rouse-involvement/). He coins the phrase "delight innovation". I love that phrase. He's talking about taking a browser, something that's relatively stable, and looking for ways to make it noticeably better again. I love that impulse - it's something I'm hoping to see in email clients too.

Another place that delight showed up (along with Surprise and Joy), was at [52 weeks of UX](http://52weeksofux.com) in a post called ["design for delight"](http://52weeksofux.com/post/531355592/design-for-delight). That post  seemed to be a little more about the parts of design that don't affect functionality, but do add personality. I really agree with this angle too - I like a program that has little details that are [just for fun](http://borkware.com/quickies/single?id=319).
