The old debate over donation-ware and pricing has popped up again, in response to [Peter Maurer][pm]'s [Textpander][tp], since expanded into [TextExpander][te]. The debate rages in comments on [TUAW][tuaw] and a bit more on [HawkWings][hw]. Both TUAW and the [MacUser][mu] blog choose to call it "freeware", which is technically true, but blurs the lines in an important way.

Peter's stuff is released with no price, just a polite suggestion over on the side: "If you decide to use Witch regularly, please do consider making a donation." He doesn't say how much. In my experience, even getting a $5 donation from a happy user is really a boost. Free coffee in the morning is awfully nice - add in a comment saying what you like about my app, and it makes me want to impress you with something new.


Writing software, even small apps, is not easy. A nice polished donationware app with all the trimmings represents a serious investment of time. When I was working on [BibDesk][bd], I would hack on it for 4-5 hours at a time every couple of days. As I've discovered over the past year or so, it's not something you can really do intermittently.



I bet that many of Peter's Textpander users have real jobs. We grad students call you "real people." If a real person goes for one week at grande instead of venti, or ate ramen for a night instead of going to Outback, the change is more than enough to make the Mac software world a better place.

Why? Just think of all the bad apps you have to pay for from big companies who don't really get it, and then think whether a few bucks is worth it to support software that actually works the way you like. Your dollar might be the one that seals the decision for the next [Gus Mueller](http://flyingmeat.com), [Fraser Speirs](http://connectedflow.com), [Mike Piatek-Jimenez](http://www.gauchosoft.com/), [Daniel Jalkut](http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/) or [Steve Gehrman](http://www.cocoatech.com) to start developing full-time.

I'm glad to hear that Peter made some money. You might think that $30 is too much for TextExpander, but don't fault him for selling his app - he doesn't owe us anything, not after the huge gift of his free time and talent he already donated to us.
