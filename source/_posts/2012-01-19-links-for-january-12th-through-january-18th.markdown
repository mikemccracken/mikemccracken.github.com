My shared links for January 12th through January 18th:






  * [Steven Frank: Notes: Home](http://stevenf.com/notes/) - 


  * [CVXPY documentation -- CVXPY v0.0.1 documentation](http://www.stanford.edu/~ttinoco/cvxpy/) - Optimization, uses Disciplined Convex Programming


  * [Progression: Supporting Optimisation in Haskell Â« Communicating Haskell Processes](http://chplib.wordpress.com/2010/02/04/progression-supporting-optimisation-in-haskell/) - Tools for benchmarking haskell performance


  * [1.-Environment setup](http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/1.-Environment%20setup.html) - 


  * [The GNU Prolog web site](http://www.gprolog.org/) - Free GNU Prolog - supports ISO


  * [The Ciao System](http://www.ciaohome.org/) - "Ciao is a general-purpose programming language which supports logic, constraint, functional, higher-order, and object-oriented programming styles. Its main design objectives are high expressive power, extensibility, safety, reliability, and efficient execution"


  * [Marmalade: Spreadable Elisp](http://marmalade-repo.org/) - A repository for elisp packages. Uses ELPA. Didn't work when I tried it, but maybe a firewall issue?


  * [Haddock Documentation Generator for Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haddock/) - Really nice documentation generator for Haskell code.

I particularly like the synopsis tab.


  * [Archives of the Caml mailing list > Message from Xavier Leroy [2002]](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/ml-archives/caml-list/2002/11/64c14acb90cb14bedb2cacb73338fb15.fr.html) - From 2002:
"In summary: there is no SMP support in OCaml, and it is very very
unlikely that there will ever be.  If you're into parallelism, better
investigate message-passing interfaces."


  * [Archives of the Caml mailing list > Message from Benjamin C. Pierce](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/ml-archives/caml-list/2002/04/a20d07d890dc2ebd525fbe3eed177492.en.html) - Lots of links about CPS and continuations in Ocaml and others.
