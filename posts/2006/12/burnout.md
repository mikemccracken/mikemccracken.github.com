A great article about Burnout and "Hurry-sickness" from New York magazine - "[Where Work is a Religion, Work Burnout is Its Crisis of Faith](http://nymag.com/news/features/24757/index.html?imw=Y)" Interesting, but thankfully not as relevant now as it would've been a year ago.

One quote I loved (and would love to see proof of:)


> 
Elevator engineers even have a term for how long it takes—door dwell—before people start jamming their fingers on the door close button, which is usually a placebo, a function already disabled by litigation-conscious building managers



This reminds me of an idea I had in high school to add a "Go Faster" button to Netscape's toolbar. It wouldn't do anything, but it'd give you something to do while waiting for the Cool Site of the Day to load.
