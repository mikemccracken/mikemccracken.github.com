If you use [BibDesk](http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/), I want to hear how you use it - what features you use most, and how you have it set up.

I've added a page to the BibDesk wiki to share [User Screenshots](http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/User_Screenshots) - add a section there about what you do with BibDesk, and share your experiences. I added my own thoughts already, to get things started.

(Note, image uploading on the wiki is broken right now, I'll fix it as soon as I can and update this post. Please add text anyway!)
