From the [HN thread](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=747096) on [this post](http://garry.posterous.com/practicing-product-minimalism) from Garry at posterous, about product minimalism:

Two things: The thread was about how high quality software is easier without politics you get in large teams, which I agree with, and I bet that a lot of the software we love was made by smaller teams than you'd think.

And, just 3 engineers on Mail explains a lot.
