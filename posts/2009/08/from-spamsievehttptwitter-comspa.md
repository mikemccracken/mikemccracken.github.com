From [@spamsieve](http://twitter.com/spamsieve), I heard that BareBones' Mailsmith has a new home:  [mailsmith.org](http://www.mailsmith.org). It's freeware and will be under development.

It's great to see new life for one of the few alternative desktop mail clients for OS X, and while there's no info on their plans for it yet, there's some great discussion of possible features on the google group [mailsmith-talk](http://groups.google.com/group/mailsmith-talk).

I'll be curious to see if any of the design choices will be changing - for example, no IMAP support and no inline HTML display... I have to use IMAP, and despite common abuse, I do think HTML email is useful.

**edit**: Looks like no Mailsmith IMAP: "Not any time soon…" – [@siegel on twitter](http://twitter.com/siegel/status/3386768085)
