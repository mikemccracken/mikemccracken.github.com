michael-mccracken.net is a weblog.

Michael McCracken is a computer scientist at Sun Microsystems Labs, in Austin, TX. I have also been a graduate student in computer science at UC San Diego, working with researchers at the San Diego Supercomputer Center. Before that, I was at Penn State, CSE class of 2001. I was also an undergraduate research intern at Lawrence Livermore National Lab in CASC, 2000 and 2001.

This weblog is not much of a personal site. Mostly it's about my side interests in Mac OS X programming and related geeky stuff.
