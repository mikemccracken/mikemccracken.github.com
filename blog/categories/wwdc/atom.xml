    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/xcode.html">XCode 3.0 preview page</a> is a cornucopia of new stuff that I somehow missed all day &ndash; until now.</p>

<p>No doubt this is the stuff that everyone at WWDC is talking about. This page represents no less than 3 or 4 really significant changes and some really nice details. Here&rsquo;s a hit list that I haven&rsquo;t seen in any of the coverage I&rsquo;ve been looking at today:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Garbage Collection</strong> in ObjC. I&rsquo;m curious about the details, but I&rsquo;m also certain that it&rsquo;s a good thing. I really just think this is a no-brainer and we&rsquo;ll all be asking how we lived without it in a year.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Project Snapshots</strong> &ndash; lets you fiddle with projects and go back to a good state without involving SVN. Nice, it&rsquo;s like Word Versions for XCode. Handy, but a little puzzling why it seems to be duplicating version control functionality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Research Assistant</strong> &ndash; A &lsquo;lightweight window&rsquo; for reference and API docs. Long overdue, and sounds really handy. Basically what I <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/blog/blosxom.pl/2004/07/07">asked for</a> in a Dashboard Widget long ago.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/content/dtrace/">DTrace</a></strong> for Mac OS &ndash; this is an extremely useful and powerful dynamic tracing framework from Sun &ndash; with a <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/howtoguides/dtracehowto.jsp#1">DSL for tracing</a> called &ldquo;D&rdquo;, and I&rsquo;m really surprised to see it on OS X. This is nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Leveraging DTrace, <strong>XRay</strong> visualizes program behavior. I think DTrace itself is more interesting, based on my experiences with visualization of parallel program behavior and developers (generally allergic) reaction to it, but it&rsquo;s interesting to see Apple give it a serious try. The ability to &ldquo;track UI events&rdquo; sounds tantalizingly useful.</p></li>
<li><p>A new text editor &ndash; apparently it can shade text backgrounds according to scope. This could either be a non-starter or really great. I think some will love it after a while and some will hate it immediately. Which are you? Oh, it also does iChat-style popups on your breakpoints. Okay.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, Interface Builder 3.0, where they spend a lot of time talking about some extra palletized stuff you can drop in, which is all well and good, but then they drop the boom in the last two sentences: <strong><em>&ldquo;Interface Builder 3.0 makes localization and diffing easier. And you can include your NIBs in global refactoring tasks.&rdquo;</em></strong> Whoa! That sound you just heard? <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/blog/blosxom.pl/2004/07/07">It was me from 2004</a>, cheering them on.</p></li>
</ul>


<p> <strong>Update</strong>: <code>s/XCode/Xcode/</code> &ndash; thanks.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I can&rsquo;t make it in person to either WWDC or Buzz&rsquo;s party this year, and as a result, I&rsquo;m bummed right out. But I haven&rsquo;t sulked, I thought of your feelings too. I came up with a way to make it seem kind of like I was there anyway. It&rsquo;s so crazy, it just might work:</p>

<p><strong>Mike McCracken WWDC flashcards!</strong></p>

<p>Just print one or all of the following pictures, and bring them with you to WWDC. They&rsquo;re all cropped to a 3x5 ratio, so you can tuck them into your HPDA and flash them when appropriate, like a soccer referee &ndash; I suggest the following interpretations:</p>

<p>Use &ldquo;Morning Mike&rdquo; when you need a non-verbal way to tell someone that it&rsquo;s just too early to discuss APIs, GUIs, or what to do now that Apple makes a free version of your only product:</p>

<p><a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/img/card0.jpg"><img src="http://michael-mccracken.net/img/card0.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Use &ldquo;Confused Mike (Afternoon session)&rdquo; whenever someone says something that just doesn&rsquo;t make <em>sense</em>. Whether it&rsquo;s their fault, or yours! Bonus points for use when you see a new abuse of the human interface guidelines. This card may also be appropriate just after seeing the amazing demo of Apple&rsquo;s free version of your only product:</p>

<p><a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/img/card1.jpg"><img src="http://michael-mccracken.net/img/card1.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Use &ldquo;Cheers Mike&rdquo; to suggest a trip to the bar, get women to pose with you, or to celebrate the continued absence of a free version of your only product. This may be the only appropriate card to sport during Buzz&rsquo;s can&rsquo;t-miss <a href="http://weblog.scifihifi.com/2006/07/23/party-time-excellent/#comments">Weblogger&rsquo;s Party</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/img/card2.jpg"><img src="http://michael-mccracken.net/img/card2.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>But remember, those are only guidelines. Be creative &ndash; my WWDC experience is in your hands!</p>

<p>If you take a picture with one of me, post it on flickr with the tag &lsquo;mikewwdc06&rsquo; so I can see where I&rsquo;ve been. Have fun at WWDC &ndash; to all of you and me!</p>
