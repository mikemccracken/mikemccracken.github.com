I've updated [AddressService](http://michael-mccracken.net/?q=AddressService) to a Universal Binary, and relicensed it under the LGPL.

AddressService is an OS X system service that lets you select a part of a person's first or last name and replace it with their addresses or phone numbers. It's handy for quick entry into an email or chat session.

I haven't been able to thoroughly test it on an Intel mac, so please let me know if you find any issues.
