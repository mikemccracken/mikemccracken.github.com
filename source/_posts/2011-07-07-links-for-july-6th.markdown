My shared links for July 6th:






  * [Computational science: ...Error : Nature News](http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101013/full/467775a.html) - "â€¦why scientific programming does not compute."

I too have worked with large codebases from non-programmers. It can be difficult to tell a brilliant physicist that programming well is hard. After QED, nothing seems hard.



  * [Attachments.me](http://attachments.me/) - A nice interface to searching your email, with a focus on attachments. But they're not a hosting provider , so it is not immediately clear what's stopping your email provider (say gmail) from adding this and wiping out the business?


  * [waffle -> Perturbingly](http://waffle.wootest.net/2011/07/06/perturbingly/) - Jesper reading the tea leaves on Growl dropping features to get into the mac app store.
