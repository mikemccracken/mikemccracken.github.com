My shared links for April 5th through April 6th:






  * [Why I still program](http://lemire.me/blog/archives/2011/06/06/why-i-still-program/) - "I believe that the rejection of programming as a lower activity can be explained by the Theory of the leisure class. In effect, we do not seek utility but prestige. There is no prestige in tool-making, cooking or farming. To maximize your prestige, you must rise up to the leisure class: you work must not be immediately useful."


  * [From counting citations to measuring usage (help needed!)](http://lemire.me/blog/archives/2012/03/20/from-counting-citations-to-measuring-usage-help-needed/) - Building a Better Citation Index


  * [workhacks.com: Top 3 Gmail Management Apps for Mac - Mailplane Blog](http://mailplaneapp.com/blog/entry/workhacks.com_top_3_gmail_management_apps_for_mac) - includes a list of gmail plugins that look useful


  * [Melopy](http://prezjordan.github.com/Melopy/) - 
<code>    
    """
    >>> from melopy import Melopy
    >>> m = Melopy('mysong')
    >>> m.add_quarter_note('A4')
    >>> m.add_quarter_note('C#5')
    >>> m.add_quarter_note('E5')
    >>> m.render()
    [==================================================] 100%
    Done
    """
</code>


  * [Rust Language Tutorial: Expression Syntax](http://doc.rust-lang.org/doc/tutorial.html#expression-syntax) - Starts out good, but the "leave out a semicolon to return a value" leaves a bad taste. Why overload semicolons like that? Why not just use 'ret'?


  * [Forget Self-Improvement](http://www.deliberatism.com/blog/forget-self-improvement/) - 


  * [The Magic of Doing One Thing at a Time - Tony Schwartz - Harvard Business Review](http://blogs.hbr.org/schwartz/2012/03/the-magic-of-doing-one-thing-a.html) - A few good points on avoiding multitasking burnout. Nothing too new, but maybe if people keep repeating it in places like HBR, then it'll start to become conventional business wisdom?
