I wouldn't normally post something about my weblog software, but I was apparently stumbling along with a really old wordpress that didn't accept new comments anymore, so I've upgraded.

As a result my custom theme bit it, and I am fresh out of PHP edits. So I'm trying this twitter-inspired thing out, the new "P2" theme for wordpress. It might make a good place for things that won't fit in twitter.

So say hi, leave a comment and let's do this thing.
