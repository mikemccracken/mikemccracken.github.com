The amazing Christiaan Hofman has released another nice update to [Skim](http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/), the great PDF reader that is quite literally my dream reader app.

As usual, there are detailed and complete [release notes](http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?group_id=192583&release;_id=535138), and I'd like to call attention to my favorite new feature, because I use it all the time, and actually wrote part of it:

>   Skim can now download PDFs from remote URLs, which can be provided on the clipboard, dropped on the Skim icon, or through Services.

I use this all the time to drag a PDF URL from a browser to the Skim dock icon - Skim downloads the file and displays it in one step. Very handy.
