My shared links for July 1st through July 2nd:






  * [Crash Course: Design for Startups -- PaulStamatiou.com](http://paulstamatiou.com/startup-web-design-ux-crash-course) - Some design tips and a big reading list.


  * [High Society (1901-1959)](http://amodernist.blogspot.com/2011/07/high-society-1901-1959.html) - Everything is a remix, including riffs in Jazz over forty years. Great YouTube examples. My favorite is the Benny Goodman.


  * [Distributed Bug Tracking Avoids Out-of-Sync Bugs and Code (Paul Roub)](http://blog.roub.net/2011/07/distributed_bug_tracking_dvcs_.html) - Distributed bug tracking sounds great - I've had that idea before, and seen it elsewhere -  but this post didn't explain much about how it works in veracity, unfortunately.


  * [Core77 intro to sketchnotes](http://m.core77.com/blog/sketchnotes/sketchnotes_101_the_basics_of_visual_note-taking_19678.asp) - How to start sketching notes. Step 2: Internet fame! Seriously though, I wish more people in research were comfortable sketching. So many dull labeled boxes on whiteboards.


  * [python-constraint - Labix](http://labix.org/python-constraint) constraint solving library in python. Nice API.
