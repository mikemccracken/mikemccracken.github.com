There are a couple minor improvements in the pipeline, but I wanted to get a universal binary version of the I-Search plugin out before you noticed that it wasn't universal already. It's the same as the last version, just twice as fat. Get it [here](http://michael-mccracken.net/IncrementalSearchInputManager-universal.zip).

Next up for this project is to move it to the stalled [leverage](http://leverage.sf.net) project.
